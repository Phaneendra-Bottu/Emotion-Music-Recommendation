###"Will You Be There"###

Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

Hold me
Like the river Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
Show me
(Lay your head lowly)
Told me
(Softly then boldly)
Yeah
(Carry me there)
I'm only human

(Lead me)
Hold me
(Love me and feed me)
Yeah, yeah
(Kiss me and free me)
Yeah
(I will feel blessed)
I'm only human

(Carry)
Carry
(Carry me boldly)
Carry, yeah
(Lift me up slowly)
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)
I will be there

(Lift me)
Told me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
Yeah
(Show me you care)
Show me you care

(Hold me)
Woo
(Lay your head lowly)
It gets lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly)
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
Woo
(Love me and feed me)
Lift me up, hold me up
(Kiss me and free me)
Lift me up sometimes, oh, sometimes
(I will feel blessed)
Yeah

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?

In my trials
And my tribulations
Through our doubts
And frustrations

In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear
And my confessions

In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

###"Earth Song"###

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?

What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

Hey, what about yesterday?
(What about us?)
What about the seas?
(What about us?)
Heavens are falling down
(What about us?)
I can't even breathe
(What about us?)

What about apathy?
(What about us?)
I need you
(What about us?)
What about nature's worth?
(Ooh, ooh)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us?)

What about animals?
(What about it?)
Turned kingdoms to dust?
(What about us?)
What about elephants?
(What about us?)
Have we lost their trust?
(What about us?)

What about crying whales
(What about us?)
Ravaging the seas?
(What about us?)
What about forest trails
(Ooh, ooh)
Burnt despite our pleas?
(What about us?)

What about the holy land
(What about it?)
Torn apart by creed?
(What about us?)
What about the common man?
(What about us?)
Can't we set him free?
(What about us?)

What about children dying?
(What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh, ooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us?)

What about baby boy?
(What about it?)
What about the days?
(What about us?)
What about all their joy?
(What about us?)
What about the man?
(What about us?)

What about the crying man?
(What about us?)
What about Abraham?
(What about us?)
What about death again?
(Ooh, ooh)
Do we give a damn!

Ah, hee-hee, ooh (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Ah, ooh (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)

###"Loving You"###

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hoo

And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, I'll be loving you)
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do ('cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do

###"All The Things You Are"###

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some, some, some, some, day 
My happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
Someday you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
All the things you are, got to be mine

###"We've Had Enough"###

Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die?
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun

In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?

Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice

Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby

We can't take it
We've already had enough

Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and let God decide
Deep in my soul
It's up to me and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

It's going down baby
Just let God decide
It's going on baby
Just let God decide

Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough

You're my lover
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

Oh lord, oh lord
Deep in my soul, babe
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?
Oh no, hold on
Yeah

###"Just A Little Bit Of You"###

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby, it's all I need, it's all I need

Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit, baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So don't send no doctor to my door
'Cause Doctor John has been here before
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Bring your loving and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a, 
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

###"Heal The World"###

Think about—um—the generations and they say we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they they they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
To make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace

Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying

Make a better place
For you and for me

###"My Girl"###

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May

Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

###"2 Bad"###

I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

[Michael Jackson:]
Told me that you're doing wrong

You're aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you hunting me
(Yeah yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place

[Shaquille O'Neal:]
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team
Theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel
Organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim
Take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

###"It's The Falling In Love"###

[Patti Austin (Michael Jackson):]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)

[Michael Jackson:]
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause

No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)

[Patti Austin:]
And though I am tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is sayin', "Come and do me!"

[Michael Jackson:]
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the bed to see of what might be
But here I go fallin' again

[Michael Jackson (Patti Austin) {Both}:]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
(Over you, over you) All night
(It's the fallin' in love) You got me fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love (Being in love makes me)
{Cry, cry, cry}

[Michael Jackson:]
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'

###"Dangerous"###

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me," I said, "I have no time." (Hee-hee!)
She said, "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone." (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said, "You know my name."
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before."
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Whoa!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Dangerous
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!

Ooh, don't walk away

Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

See, and why
All my dreams been broken

With everything we said and all we done now

You are there like the laughter of a child
When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while

Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along
Thanks to you I finally got a song

'Cause you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it's falling down
Things look up just having you around
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You're the answer to the prayers I say

And you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it through
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there, somewhere
And as the years go by we'll stay as true
What you are for me I'll be for you
And every night I'll say a prayer
Just because you're there

Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there
Everywhere, you are there

###"Can't Let Her Get Away"###

I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But every time I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye (Still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling, trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling, she's never gonna try
I got the feeling, she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling, her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling, she's out to play
Can't let go
Can't let go

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

The way you talk to me
The way you're lovin' me
The way you you give it to me
You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah ooh)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world)
You know you did
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl)
You know you did
(Baby, baby, baby)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

###"Ghosts"###

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

I don't understand it
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

Don't understand it!
(Gotta ghost gotta break in the walls)
Yeah yeah!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
You're just a dog gone!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Aaow!

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to scare my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow!

Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

###"You Can't Win"###

You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only have yourself to blame

[Michael Jackson:]
You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Michael Jackson (The Crows):]
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back) (And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

Sayin' you can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't win no way
If your story stays the same
(You ain't winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't break even
Ain't the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

You can't win, chile
(No, you can't win)
(No, you can't win)
(No, you can't win)
(No, you can't win)

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out, a-hoooooo!
You can't get out of the game now, hah!
No, no, ah, d'ah

###"Scared Of The Moon"###

Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

###"Black Or White"###

[Dad:] Hey!
[Kid:] What?!
[Dad:] Turn that off!
[Kid:] Dad, this is the best part!
[Dad:] Turn it off!
[Kid:] No!
[Dad:] It's too late for this. Turn it off!
[Kid:] Dad, this is the best part! Come on!
[Dad:] No, turn it off now!
[Kid:] No, this is the—I want to listen to it, OK?!
[Dad:] You've got things to do tomorrow ... turn it off now!
[Kid:] Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this.

[Michael Jackson:]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
Ooh

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh

Don't look at that

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

[L.T.B.:]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Michael Jackson:]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to be that (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to be that (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah)

###"Dear Michael"###

She wrote: "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter, Michael
I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more"

"Dear Michael (Michael, Michael)
Every time (She wrote) your record's on, Michael (Michael, Michael)
I close my eyes (She wrote) and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me"

And then, she wrote: "Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"

I'm gonna answer your letter (Michael, Michael)
I'll start beginning (She wrote) with the ABC's of loving you (Michael, Michael)
Your letter (She wrote) really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting the picture that you sent along
Signed with all your love

(Michael, Michael)
(I wrote you)
(She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back, ooh
I promise you that

Girl, I think I love you
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry, mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) Yeah
(I wrote you) (She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back
I promise you that
Tell her I love her

(Ouch)

###"We Are Here To Change The World"###

We're on a mission in the everlastin' light that shines
A revelation of the truth in chapters of our minds

(So long, bad times)
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharin' a light brighter than the sun
(Hello, good times)
We're here to simulate, eliminate
And congregate, illuminate

(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, hee!
(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, ooh!

So do surrender 'cause the power is deep inside my soul
Ah, sing it

Deep down in my body
Deep down in my soul, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world
Ooh!

###"I Just Can't Stop Loving You"###

I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God, I need you
I love you so much

[Michael:]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer

[Siedah:]
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

[Michael (Siedah):]
I just can't hold on, (I feel we belong)
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Both (Siedah):]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
('Cause I just can't stop loving you)

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find a love so true
(When morning awakes me, will you come and take me? I'll wait for you)
You know how I feel, I won't stop until I hear your voice saying, "I do" ("I do")
(This thing can't go wrong), this feeling's so strong
(Well, my life ain't worth living), {if I can't be with you}

{I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you}
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
{And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do}
(Uh-huh)
I just can't stop loving you

(We can change all the world tomorrow)
We can sing songs of yesterday
(I can say "Hey. Farewell" to sorrow)
This is my life and I {want to see you for always}

[Michael & Siedah:]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh, oh) (Oh, whoa-whoa!)

###"She Drives Me Wild"###

She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine

She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin'
'Cause I've seen her look better

She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better

Come to the place, shock to see
And you know damn well you know what I mean

Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip, like you've never seen

Uh-huh!

Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
And she knows she looks hot

She's got position
She's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild
I might not make it
Uh-huh!
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
Uh-huh!
Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You walk is soft, still I hear the medley
Uh-huh! Shiver my Timberland boots, cramp my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's driving me wild

I love you madly

You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me

###"Too Young"###

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go

And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

###"Carousel"###

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart) Lost my heart
(On the carousel) Lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost (Lost my heart)
I lost my girl (On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost (To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)

###"Monster"###

[Michael Jackson:]
You can look at them comin' out the walls
You can look at them climbin' out the bushes
You can find them when the letter's 'bout to fall
He be waitin' with his camera right on focus

Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air there's a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumpin' like you should
(Too bad)
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you like it?
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Monster, yeah, he's a monster, he's an animal, ho-oh-oh

He's coming at you
Coming at you rather too fast
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
And you're runnin'
And you're runnin' just to 'scape it
But they're gunnin' for the money
So they fake it

Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air, there's a monster
When you see them in the street
That's a monster, monster, monster

(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumping like it should
It's got you bouncing off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like what you see
Monster, he's like an animal, (he's a monster) just like an animal (he's an animal)
And he's moving in the air
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Everybody wanna be a video star

Why are they never satisfied with'n all you give?
You give them your all, they're watching you fall
And they eat your soul (like a vegetable)

[50 Cent:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me in a bad mood, flipping, you'll take a whippin'
Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addiction
Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'
Shiver a second, now, now, now, what is it?
Funerals, cemeteries, don't worry, it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kiddin'?
It's home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
All hail, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there's nothing iller, it's killer
Their vision, they miss 'em, won't impact, this is that
It's the bomb, ring the alarm, MJ number one
It goes on and on, it goes on and on
We get to creeping and crawling in the early morn'
Dream on dreamer, there's nowhere to run
You can try but you're done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come

[Michael Jackson:]
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood has got you jumpin' like you should
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just making me clearer
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you?

Monster, say you wanna be a star
He's a monster, say you wanna go far
He's an animal, why do you keep stalking me?
Monster (what you do to me?)
He's a monster, why'd you take it? Why'd you fake it?
He's an animal, yeah, why d'you torture me?
Monster, why you stalkin' me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal
Why did you do it? Why did you? Why you stalkin' me?
Monster, why d'you torture me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal, why d'you? Why d'you? Ho-oh-oh!

He's dragging you down like a monster
He's keeping you down like a monster
He's dragging you down like a monster
He's keeping you down like a monster

###"Blood On The Dance Floor"###

She got your number, ah
She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got your baby, ah
It happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah
Erase the past (Ah)

Every night stance is like taking a chance (Ah)
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it's right (Hoo-hoo)

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend (Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (Ah)
Susie says it's right

It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Hoo!

###"In The Back"###

Why you stab me in the back?

Ow!

###"Chicago"###

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone and so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never would've thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Whoa, no
Alright
Oh (I'm in love, love)

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (Holdin' her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She's with me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

###"The Lost Children"###

We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

So pray for all the lost children
Let's pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home

###"Touch The One You Love"###

If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For every time I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you

I would get embarrassed
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch

###"I Can't Help It"###

Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no no no

###"Who Is It"###

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside a dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

Hee-hee, hee-hee
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
To me, I'm bothered
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

###"Wings Of My Love"###

When this old world gets you down
When your spirit's on the ground
Just remember I will always be around
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas, darling, we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

'Til you break those ties that bind
'Til that day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
Just climb on the wings of my love

Do-doo-doo-do-doo
Do-doo-do-doo
Doo-do-doo-do-doo-do

Oh, I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

We've got rainbows yet to find
And we'll find them all in time
Girl, I know someday we'll even touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love

(Anytime) Anytime you want to leave your world behind
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
(Take my hand) Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
(Just remember) Just remember I will always be around
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

###"Scream"###

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it

[Janet Jackson:]
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Somebody please have mercy}
{'Cause I just can't take it}

{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
You just, you just

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson):]
I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
(You keep changin' the rules)
(While I, I keep playing the game)
(I can't take it much longer)
(I think I might go insane)
Ah, baby

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie)
{Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

"A man has been brutally beaten to death by police after being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect. The man was an 18-year-old black male..."

[Janet Jackson (Michael Jackson):]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
(Baby) Whoa

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you wanna scream)
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream

###"Heartbreaker"###

[Michael Jackson:]
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
And start being without you
But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you
And stop talkin' about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

[Fats:]
You playing, huh?
I thought it was love with this game, huh?
When you dealing with the emotions of pain, huh?
Take a closer look when you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now
Heart murder in place then you'll see
It won't heal from Pepsi, they see
Ball-hard player, she's a star player
I need this crap, huh?
I didn't see the heartbreaker, so come on

[Michael Jackson:]
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

###"Little Susie"###

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...

She knew no one cared...

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair

###"She's Out Of My Life"###

She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

###"Heaven Can Wait"###

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
(My baby!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this do me!)
That's a chance I'll take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
(Don't you do this do me!)
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you, girl! I need you, baby! I want you, baby!)
Ooh

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You're beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone

###"Fall Again"###

Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone 
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Because you're always there in my dreams

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

(All of the time, here in my heart)

###"Ain't No Sunshine"###

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause, ooh

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mm

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, know
I know, know, know, know, know
Oh, I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave (Ought to leave)
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)

(Ain't no sun) Oh
(Ain't no sun)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na) Oh
(Na-na-na) Oh, oh
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sun
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
When she's gone
(It's not warm when she's away)
It's not warm when she's away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
(It's not warm when she's away)
Anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day)
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Whenever that little girl goes away
Na na na na na
(It's not warm when she's away)
(Only darkness every day)
Anytime she goes away

(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Come on, now
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Come on, baby, anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day) Na na na
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Oh, anytime she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Na-na-na, oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Anytime when she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

###"You Are Not Alone"###

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!

###"Jam"###

[Michael Jackson:]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam

[Heavy D:]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Making funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man 'cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4s in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to

[Michael Jackson:]
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Get on it
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't stop
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you

It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam (Chh, chh, chh!)
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam (Get down, hoo!)
Ooh!
Chh!
Chh!

Ooh!
Get on it

Give it, baby
Give it to me
Come on
You really give it to me
Got to give it
You just want to give it

###"You Are My Life"###

Once, all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (You are my life)

Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me

You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope, when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars

That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)

That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life

###"Johnny Raven"###

He's born to be wild

Free and untamed that's how I've grown
(He's Johnny Raven)
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
(He's Johnny Raven)
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)

I'm Johnny Raven

By and by (By and By)
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says fly

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep, yeah, yeah
(He's Johnny Raven)
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
(He's Johnny Raven)
But I'm hungry for new thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
By and by
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you

When my restless heart says goodbye

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven, yeah, yeah

Ooh, I'm gonna fly and when you cry

###"Take Me Back"###

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go with everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I am on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the problems that I caused you
If it takes my life I will make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me

###"One Day In Your Life"###

One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

###"Xscape"###

Darkchild
Escape (Ow!)
Escape (Ow!)
Escape

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, then push them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

Escape (Escape)
I gotta get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape (Escape)

Had to go away
Escape (Escape)

Escape (Escape)
I do what I wanna, 'cause I gotta face nobody, but me
Escape

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you (You)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can't do what I want to

###"Dirty Diana"###

Oh, no, oh, no, no

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?

I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's OK
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."

She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back."
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's OK
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana! Diana! Dirty Diana!
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said, "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key,"
She said, "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)

###"Hollywood Tonight"###

[Michael Jackson:]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown to pursue her movie star dreams
And she's giving hot tricks to men just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Taryll Jackson (Michael Jackson):]
She gave up her life to follow her dreams (Again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood

[Michael Jackson:]

###"Happy"###

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand-new
Lost as a little lamb was I, 'til you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
('Til now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
'Til now

Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oehoe Happy

Happy oh yeah Happy

###"In The Closet"###

There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)

Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other (Whatever we do)

###"Speed Demon"###

Cho! Cho!
Cho! Oh!
Cho! Cho!
Cho!

I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?, I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon) Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon, he say) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho!

Ain't nothing gonna stop me, ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway, I gotta really burn this road

###"Money"###

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the Holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God, then you will hell him
You would do anything for money

Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything

Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

###"Speechless"###

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel

But I am speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I'm in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground

Speechless (speechless), speechless (speechless), that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real

I'd go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you, I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like
Like "I love you"

###"Threatened"###

[Rod Serling:]
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster

[Michael Jackson:]
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream, it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me
(No, no)

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Rod Serling:]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never-Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

[Michael Jackson:]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened
(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(So you should feel threatened by me)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened (It's you, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (C'mon, baby, yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (You should be, hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (Every time, she speaks to me) (Hoo-hoo!)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Rod Serling:]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't. It's the beginning

###"To Make My Father Proud"###

To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style
If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

War without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared and unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile

###"Human Nature"###

Why?

Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Just tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why? Why?), why (why? Why? Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way

Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

###"Whatever Happens"###

[Michael Jackson:]
He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

See, don't you do it baby
I said yeah
Don't you let go baby
See, you
Don't you do it

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't you let go baby
Don't you, don't you let go
I said yeah
Can I get how it feels baby
Don't you let go baby
Yeah
Oh
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!

###"Why You Wanna Trip On Me"###

They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You've got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'

We have got more problems
Than we will ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walking into darkness
Tell me
What are we doing
To try to stop this?

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'

###"Much Too Soon"###

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

###"Just Good Friends"###

[Stevie Wonder (Michael Jackson):]

Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)

###"Stranger In Moscow"###

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow. Hee
Lord have mercy

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator in Russian:]
"Зачем приехал к нам ты, враг, от запада? Признайся.
Приехал чтобы украсть от нас великие достижения народа?
Великие труды рабочих?
Признайся. Подкупить народ богатством запада старался?"
[English translation:
"Why have you come, the enemy, from the west? Confess.
Have you come to steal from us the great achievements of the people?
The great accomplishments of the workers?
Confess. Have you tried hard to bribe the people with the riches of the west?"]

###"Call On Me"###

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere

Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me

###"Monkey Business"###

Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what is going down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
I don't ever wanna say it
'Cause it's all blasphemy
Everybody is doing it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Oh yeah)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be calling down babe
Said Lord have mercy
Even worse the birthday
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be going down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doing it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (doggone)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It is too much
Monkey business going down

I read the paper
And I can't believe what's going 'round
Somebody is doing it to
Somebody is up, somebody is down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shine with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you
(You are dirty, you are dirty, dirty, dirty baby)
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hee-hee) (Hoo-hoo)
Your brother didn't make it out the two times two
You sitting 'round here telling how he did it to you 
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

(Going down babe)
Monkey business going down
(You are not satisfied baby)
Monkey business going down
(You wanna party)
Monkey business going down
(My business is your business)
Monkey business going down
(I caught your mother she doing a dude
She can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
(And monkey see, monkey do

Monkey business going down
Your business is my business

Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business
Too much for the kids, baby
It's a monkey business going down

###"Childhood"###

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood?

###"Is It Scary?"###

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?

And if you wanna to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light

But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?
Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
'Cause the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me am I scary for you baby? (Hoo!)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is scary for you baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Am I scary for you? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't wanna talk about it) (Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it) (Hoo!)

Is this scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby

###"Man In The Mirror"###

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind
You see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
('Cause you better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart

You can't close your your mind
(Then you close your mind!)

That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)

Oh, no, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Shamone
Change

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it yourself
(Yeah! Hoo! Make that change!)
I gotta make that change today, hoo
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know
I gotta get that man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move
Shamone, shamone
You got to stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah. Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself now
(Man in the mirror)

Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow!

(Yeah. Make that change)
Gonna make that change
Shamone
(Man in the mirror)

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know

Change
Make that change

###"Give In To Me"###

She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay, yes it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me, baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is wrong
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling

###"HIStory"###

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...

Every day create your history

Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

###"Thriller"###

[Michael Jackson:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side (ooh)
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller (ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whomsoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight...

Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh

[Vincent Price:]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
(Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]

###"I Wanna Be Where You Are"###

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry, 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

###"We've Got Forever"###

(We've got forever, forever)

I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Me and you, baby
(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever)

###"Farewell My Summer Love"###

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

###"Someone Put Your Hand Out"###

Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I have to think about it

I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside

The truth is that I'm longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains

I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on...

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love

###"Smile"###

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
If you just...

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

###"Best Of Joy"###

I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you, I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you", we are forever

I am the one who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be (The only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady, let come what may we do get by

I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you

We are forever (I am forever, alright)
We are forever (I am forever, uh-huh)
We are forever (ah, what you do? What ya' live for?)

###"Keep Your Head Up"###

She's lookin' for a job and to find a place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promisin'
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside every time her baby cries, no

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive

Keep your head up, don't give up today
How long can we wait?

Everybody say that time is borrowed
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance
Fight your circumstance
Rise and do it again

###"A Place With No Name"###

As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
A place without no name
Take me to (Can't believe) a place without (I can't believe) no name
Take me to a place without no name

Whoa, yeah
Don't go, oh

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies, and the birds
And the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

Take me to (Don't go) a place
Without (I can't believe) no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
Take me to (I can't believe) a place without (Don't go) no name
A place without no name
Take me to (See) a place without no name

No, no, no
La, la, la, la, la (La, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (See, a place without)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (I can't believe, I can't believe)
La, la, la, la (I can't believe it)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

###"Up Again"###

Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed by my side
You make the sun shine

I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time

I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

###"Melodie"###

I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going nowhere

When I saw my sweet Melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of the love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you've told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

###"Break Of Dawn"###

Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, making love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go

Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I'll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love 'til the break of dawn

There's imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never known

(Break of dawn, break of dawn) there's no sun up in the sky

Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, making love 'til it's dark
Let me move, let me soothe, 'til the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

Break it down

###"I'll Come Home To You"###

If I had my way, girl
I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want 'em to
So, while I'm away, now
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you

Let this love lift you up
When you're feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there
Ooh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
Ooh, just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Oh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Oh, wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, darling

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, baby

Wherever I go, whatever I do

###"In Our Small Way"###

We may not change the world in one day

###"Behind The Mask"###

All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
You know me

There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (Cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know

I don't want you
If you can't answer

You got me scared, girl

(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na

Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask

I walk around I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you

###"Invincible"###

[Michael Jackson:]
Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you, my baby

[Fats (Michael Jackson):]
Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, y'all have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

[Michael Jackson:]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in-, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

###"Off The Wall"###

When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

Livin' crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf

Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (A-hee!)

Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat

She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old

###"Someone In The Dark"###

All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!

###"Euphoria"###

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It is very easy to say

Say euphoria
And you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still

Watch rainbows glow
Rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full of v-vigour and vim
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn

Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthy and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues

Euphoria
Never to feel frustration
How great to give
Love without limitation

Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another

Euphoria, euphoria
That's the new word for heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
Living in love is heaven

Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria

###"Love Is Here And Now You're Gone"###

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you, and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you (Love, love is here)
Oh oh, my darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My baby, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

###"Billie Jean"###

She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do.
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."
And mother always told me, "A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth."

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)

She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three."
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby

A-people always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."
(Don't break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, no, no

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there's not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don't call me Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

So baby, be mine, girl

###"The Girl Is Mine"###

[Michael Jackson:]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine, m-m-m

[Paul McCartney:]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he

[Michael Jackson:]
(Take you anywhere)
Well, I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me to one town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Paul McCartney:]

###"Privacy"###

Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end, again

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, yeah yeah yeah

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky, oh no (Gonna take somebody's help)

If we all cry at the same time tonight

###"Remember The Time"###

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall
We'd be together all day long?
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

Do you remember, back in the spring
Every morning, birds would sing?
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Hoo! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, hoo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flapping their wings singing, "Go, bird, go"

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Yeah, yeah!

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the Buzzard and the Oriole

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

###"Gone Too Soon"###

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon

###"This Is It"###

Ooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet you
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
Ooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
You'll see
Ooh [10x]

###"Morning Glow"###

Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due

Morning glow, fill the earth
Come and shine for all you're worth
We'll be present at your birth
Of all things looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all day long (morning glow)
While we sing tomorrow's song (morning glow)
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow it's almost here

Oh-oh-oh morning glow
Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow, filled with light
You can make the whole day bright
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
Woo-oooh, wooh-oooh, woo-oooh, woo-oooh

###"Slave To The Rhythm"###

She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Oh)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

She works so hard just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Love, love, love)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

You got to have pride (A rhythm of love)
To give it, want it, do it, baby (A rhythm of love)

###"Tabloid Junkie"###

Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of all your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep fooling ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
But why do we keep fooling ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable

[Michael Jackson {The Notorious B.I.G}:]
You can try to stop me (Uh)
But it won't do a thing
No matter what you do
I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same
I'm {Uh} un—{Uh}—breakable {What? Uh}

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

[Michael Jackson:]
You can't believe it (Ah)
You can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable)
'Cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it (Ah)
And you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Ah, nah)
'Cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it (Ah)
You can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me (Ah)
'Cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (You hate it)
And you can't take it (Woo)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable)
'Cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hoo, hoo, hoo)
You can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (Yeah, ah)
'Cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?)
And you can't take it (Just why did you do it, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo?)
You'll never break me
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it, because I'm unbreakable

Ooh
Gone

###"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day"###

Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin'
Her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Within my heart, oh yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You have torn apart, understand me now?
And when she tells you she's crying her last tear
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
That's gonna send your baby straight to me

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that man
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
