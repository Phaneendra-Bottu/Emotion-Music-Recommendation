Eminem,Happier,Walking down 29th and park I saw you in another's arms Only a month we've been apart You look happier  Saw you walk inside a bar He said something to make you laugh I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours Yeah you look happier you do  Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you But ain't nobody love you like I do Promise that I will not take it personal baby If you're moving on with someone new  Cause baby you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too And until then I'll smile to hide the truth But I know I was happier with you  Sat in the corner of the room Everything's reminding me of you Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier Aren't you?  Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you But ain't nobody need you like I do I know that there's others that deserve you But my darling I am still in love with you  But I guess you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too I could try to smile to hide the truth But I know I was happier with you  Baby you look happier you do I knew one day you'd fall for someone new But if he breaks your heart like lovers do Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
Eminem,Hearts Don't Break Around Here,She is the sweetest thing that I know You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low Shakes my soul like a pot hole every time Took my heart upon a one way trip Guess she went wandering off with it Unlike most women I know This one will bring it back whole Daisies daisies perched upon your forehead Oh my baby lately I know  That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear Oh we're in love aren't we? Hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby I feel safe when you're holding me near Love the way that you conquer your fear You know hearts don't break around here Oh yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah  She is the river flow in Orwell And tin wind chimes used for doorbells Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs Spent my summer time beside her And the rest of the year the same She is the flint that sparks the lighter And the fuel that will hold the flame Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread Oh my hold this oh this I know  That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear Oh we're in love aren't we? Hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby I feel safe when you're holding me near Love the way that you conquer your fear You know hearts don't break around here Oh yeah yeah yeah  Well I found love in the inside The arms of a woman I know She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home And I'm not scared of passing over Or the thought of growing old Because from now until I go  Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear Oh we're in love aren't we? Hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby I feel safe when you're holding me near Love the way that you conquer your fear You know hearts don't break around here Oh yeah yeah  Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear Oh we're in love aren't we? Hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby I feel safe when you're holding me near Love the way that you conquer your fear You know hearts don't break around here Yeah yeah yeah You know hearts don't break around here Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Eminem,So,Filled up with doubt I have to move home But I want to stay with you For all of the summer I have my plan That you won't remember If you want to see the world Then please ask your mother  I cannot hold your hand To watch you go I am a liar As you might know I need you now I need your touch And your lips I need that smile [Acoustic version:] I need your smile And your kiss  [2x] You're so cool You're so beautiful You're so You're so  I see your grace From my window When it is late at night It'll show me your shadow I'm in my place Hope you remember When summer's gone I'll still sing a song Of you in September  [Acoustic version's verse:] I see your voice From my window When it is late at night It'll show me your shadow I have my plan But you won't remember it But if you want to see the world Then please ask your mother  I cannot hold your hand To watch you go I am a liar As you might know I need you now I need your touch And your lips I need that smile [Acoustic version:] I need your smile And your kiss  [2x] You're so cool You're so beautiful You're so You're so  [2x] These words I say mean You're so amazing And I've noticed lately I need you maybe  'Cause you're so cool You're so beautiful You're so You're so
Eminem,Tenerife Sea,You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that The way it falls on the side of your neck Down your shoulders and back  We are surrounded by all of these lies And people who talk too much You got the kind of look in your eyes As if no one knows anything but us  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love so in love  You look so beautiful in this light Your silhouette over me The way it brings out the blue in your eyes Is the Tenerife Sea  And all of the voices surrounding us here They just fade out when you take a breath Just say the word and I will disappear Into the wilderness  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love so in love  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love love love love So in love  You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that And in a moment I knew you Beth
