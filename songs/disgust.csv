That's how dicks be gettingtin' drips Fallin' victims to this shit I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
Ed Sheeran,Ricky Ticky Toc,Once you call my name out things will never be the same They should've never let us get our foot in this game. Anybody I throw flames at gets a name. They know that they don't spit the same. It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame every day.

Ed Sheeran,Seduction,Seduction when I tell 'em girls on the floor I don't know man. Just feels like we're a lot different. It's psychological warfare. Endorphins I affect. Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck. She loves me Such passion you'd expect this sort of reaction from her. Yet you strong arm You're fucking corny.
Eminem,Lately,[Ed:] I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe. [Devlin:] 5 o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require.
Coldplay,God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,Where do we go? Nobody knows I've got to say I'm on my way down God give me style and give me grace God put a smile upon my face  Where do we go to draw the line? I've got to say I wasted all your time Honey honey Where do I go to fall from grace? God put a smile upon your face yeah  Ah when you work it out I'm worse than you Yeah when you work it out I wanted to Ah when you work out where to draw the line Your guess is as good as mine  Where do we go? Nobody knows Don't ever say you're on your way down when God gave you style and gave you grace And put a smile upon your face ah yeah  Ah when you work it out I'm worse than you Yeah when you work it out I want it to Ah when you work out where to draw the line Your guess is as good as mine  It's as good as mine It's as good as mine It's as good as mine  As good as mine as good as mine As good as mine as good as mine  Where do we go? Nobody knows Don't ever say you're on your way down when God gave you style and gave you grace And put a smile upon your face
Michael Jackson,Is It Scary?,There's a ghost out in the hall There's a ghoul beneath the bed Now it's coming through the walls. Am I amusing you or just confusing you? Am I the beast you visualized? And if you wanna to see eccentrialities I'll be grotesque before your eyes Let them all materialize.
Michael Jackson,Thriller,[Michael Jackson:] It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart. [Vincent Price:] The foulest stench is in the air The funk of forty thousand years. And grisly ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom.
Ed Sheeran,Drug Ballad,This is my love song...it goes like this  Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot) This is how we used to make the party start We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark. By the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl and you'll probably barf.,disgust
Ed Sheeran,Sing For The Moment,These ideas are nightmares to white parents I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate They say music can alter moods and talk to you Can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?,disgust
Ed Sheeran,Puke,There I go thinking of you again  You don't know how sick you make me You make me fucking sick to my stomach Every time I think of you I puke You must just not know You may not think you do but you do. I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem But off of the dome would probably be a little more More suitable for this type of song.,disgust
