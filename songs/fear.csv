Artist Name,Song Name,Sum Lyrics
Ed Sheeran,We As Americans,There's an intruder in my house He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!) I scream for police but I doubt They're gonna hear me when I shout  A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail There's a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher And a pit bull in the seat these pigs'll get bit. We are Samaritans what do we get us in? We better check ourselves look at how shit has been Take a look where you live this is America and we are Americans.
Ed Sheeran,Bitch Please II,Snoop Dogg and D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside) Came a long way to makin' these songs play It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre But I…
Ed Sheeran,White America,Shady: I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs I'm in trouble with the government I'm lovin' it I shoveled shit all my life And now I'm dumping it on  White America
Ed Sheeran,Role Model,Okay I'm going to attempt to drown myself You can try this at home You can be just like me Mic check one-two we recordin'?  I'm cancerous so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus I'll strangle you to death then I'll choke you again.
Ed Sheeran,Space Bound,We touch I feel a rush We clutch it isn't much But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us It's lust it's torturous You must be a sorceress 'cause you just Did the impossible Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous If you fuck me over 'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt 'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you And love is evol Spell it backwards I'll show you  Nobody knows me I'm cold Walk down this road all alone It's no one's fault but my own It's the path I've chosen to go Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's Bloodsucking succubuses.
Eminem,Cold Coffee,She's like cold coffee in the morning I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke She'll make me shiver without warning And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke  And you can stay with me forever Or you could stay with me for now  Tell me if I'm wrong  Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  I'll wake with coffee in the morning But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea Outside the day is up and calling But I don't have to be so please go back to sleep  Stay with me forever Or you could stay with me for now  Tell me if I'm wrong Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  'Cause I love the way you wake me up For goodness sake will my love not be enough?  Tell me if I'm wrong Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand  To help you fall asleep tonight Tell me if I know Tell me if I do Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  Tell me if I'm wrong Tell me if I'm right Tell me if you need a loving hand To help you fall asleep tonight
Eminem,Fall,You and I Two of a mind This love’s One of a kind  You and I We’re drifting Over the edge  And I will fall for you And I will fall for you If I fall for you Would you fall too?  You and I Learning to speak With kisses on cheeks  You and I We’re lifted Over the edge  And I will fall for you And I will fall for you If I fall for you Would you fall too?  And I will fall for you And I will fall for you And if I fall for you Would you fall too?  Would you fall too? Would you fall too? Would you fall too? Would you fall too?
Eminem,New York,Ooh ooh whoa oh oh oh now now  Five drinks in on Friday night We only came to dry your eyes And get you out of your room  Now this bar has closed its doors I found my hand is holding yours Do you wanna go home so soon?  Or maybe we should take a ride Through the night And sing along to every song That's on the radio In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no no no The sun could rise Burning all the street lamps out at 3 AM So DJ play it again  Until the night turns into morning You'll be in my arms And we'll just keep driving Along the boulevard And if I kissed you darling Please don't be alarmed It's just the start of everything If you want a new love in New York  Yesterday gave me a call Stressing out about it all Said the world is moving too fast  And you don't know where to begin 'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in Only to wind up on the other side  By yourself And every day Screaming out To all the people that you used to know From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline It's just the way that life goes And you hear it in every song you know So DJ play it again  Until the night turns into morning You'll be in my arms And we'll just keep driving Along the boulevard And if I kissed you darling Please don't be alarmed It's just the start of everything If you want a new life in New York  And every song that plays Is just like the day you had And it's okay to cry But I'm saying maybe that's a waste of water You know I'm here for you In the back of the taxi cab tonight in New York  It's just reached the morning And you're still in my arms And we've stopped driving Down the boulevard And I just kissed you darling I hope you weren't alarmed It's just the start of everything That you want: a new love in New York  A new life in New York
Eminem,Fire Alarms,The rain wont stop falling It's harder than before This car keeps on stalling Pedal to the floor  What I need to know Is if you love me and I Really need to know Is if you want me when you call If you want me when you call  We were young and we were foolish School books in our arms Dodging homework dodging classes To set off fire alarms  And what I need to know Is if you love me and I Really need to know If you need me when you call If you want me when you call  We are waving our lives away We are waving our lives away We are waving our lives away We are waving our lives away  We are waving (and what I need to know) We are waving (is if you love me and I) We are waving (really need to know) We are waving (if you need me when you call) We are waving (what I need to know) We are waving (is if you love me and I) We are waving (really need to know) We are waving (if you need me when you call)  What I need to know Is if you love me and I Really need to know If you need me when you call If you want me when you call
Eminem,Dive,Maybe I came on too strong Maybe I waited too long Maybe I played my cards wrong Oh just a little bit wrong Baby I apologise for it  I could fall or I could fly Here in your aeroplane And I could live I could die Hanging on the words you say I've been known to give my all And jumping in harder than 10000 rocks on the lake  So don't call me baby Unless you mean it And don't tell me you need me If you don't believe it So let me know the truth Before I dive right into you  You're a mystery I have travelled the world And there's no other girl like you no one What's your history? Do you have a tendency to lead some people on? Cause I heard you do  I could fall or I could fly Here in your aeroplane And I could live I could die Hanging on the words you say And I've been known to give my all And lie awake every day Don't know how much I can take  So don't call me baby Unless you mean it And don't tell me you need me If you don't believe it So let me know the truth Before I dive right into you  I could fall or I could fly Here in your aeroplane I could live I could die Hanging on the words you say I've been known to give my all Sitting back looking at Every mess that I made  So don't call me baby Unless you mean it And don't tell me you need me If you don't believe it let me know the truth Before I dive right into you Before I dive right into you Before I dive right into you
Eminem,I See Fire,Oh misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durin's sons  If this is to end in fire Then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night  Calling out father oh Stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on The mountain side  And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time  Calling out father oh Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn auburn on The mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire Inside the mountain I see fire Burning the trees And I see fire Hollowing souls I see fire Blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  Oh should my people fall Then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls We got too close to the flame  Calling out father oh Hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on The mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire Inside the mountain I see fire Burning the trees I see fire Hollowing souls I see fire Blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me  And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns Then my brothers will die And as the sky is falling down It crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out  Now I see fire Inside the mountains I see fire Burning the trees I see fire Hollowing souls I see fire Blood in the breeze  I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire) And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin yeah) (fire) And I see fire (uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire) And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
Eminem,You Need Me,I Don't Need You Singer-songwriter says he's not a product of his genre. 'I'm like glue I stick to other artists I'm not you now that would be disastrous' 'You need me man I don't need you' 'I won't stop 'til my name's in lights with Damien Rice'
Eminem,Where We Land,Treat me beneath this clear night sky And I will lie with you I start to feel those butterflies When I'm next to you  Tell me your secrets Give me a friend Let all the good times flood in Do I love you? Do I hate you? I can't make up my mind So let's freefall See where we land  It's been this way since we were young We'll fight and then make up I'll breathe your air into my lungs When I feel your touch  Tell me your secrets Give me a friend Let all the good times flood in Do I love you? Do I hate you? I can't make up my mind So let's freefall And see where we land  Tada ra ra Tada ra ra Tada ra ra  Tada ra ra Tada ra ra Tada ra ra  Tell me your secrets Give me a friend Let all the good times flood in Do I love you? Do I hate you? I can't make up my mind So let's freefall And see where we land
Eminem,Touch And Go,Waking up midnight November And you're still in my bed It's kinda rough 'cause since I met ya There's things we've never said  So if I go for a little while longer When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road If you say go I would stop everything oh My heart would play the role now And act like it's never been broke  Though my soul Oh oh oh lately I really need to know How long how long can we be touch and go Oh my soul oh oh oh How long how long can we be touch and go  It's not enough to say I want ya 'Cause I'll say anything I'm holding out to feel without a doubt I ha... have just been questioning yeah  If I go for a little while longer When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road If you say go I would stop everything oh My heart would play the role And act like it's never been broke  Though my soul Oh oh oh lately I really need to know How long how long can we be touch and go Oh my soul oh oh oh How long how long can we be  All of my bones they scream I'm right If you're taking me home to stay the night Darling my soul would heal  If you say go I would stop everything oh My heart would play the role And act like it's never been broke though my soul Lately I really need to know How long how long can we be touch and go Oh my soul oh oh oh How long how long can we be touch and go How long how long can we be touch and go How long how long can we be touch and go
Taylor Swift,State Of Grace,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know Is touch and go  We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (never) be the same  You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannonball Now all we know Is don't let go  We are alone just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs Four blue eyes  So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (never) be the same  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right  These are the hands of fate You're my Achilles' heel This is the golden age of something good and right and real  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (never) be the same  And I never (never) saw you coming And I'll never (So you were never a saint I've loved in shades of wrong) Be the same (We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild)  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,I Almost Do,I bet this time of night you're still up I bet you're tired from a long hard week I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city And I bet sometimes you wonder about me  And I just wanna tell you It takes everything in me not to call you And I wish I could run to you And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do  I bet you think I either moved on or hate you 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say Hello to you And risk another goodbye  And I just wanna tell you It takes everything in me not to call you And I wish I could run to you And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do  Oh we made quite a mess babe It's probably better off this way And I confess babe In my dreams you're touching my face And asking me if I wanna try again with you And I almost do  And I just wanna tell you It takes everything in me not to call you And I wish I could run to you And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do  I bet this time of night you're still up I bet you're tired from a long hard week I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
Taylor Swift,I Knew You Were Trouble,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago I was in your sights you got me alone You found me you found me you found me I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that And when I fell hard you took a step back Without me without me without me  And he's long gone when he's next to me And I realize the blame is on me  'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been 'Til you put me down oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh oh trouble trouble trouble Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  No apologies. He'll never see you cry Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why You're drowning you're drowning you're drowning Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be And now I see now I see now I see  He was long gone when he met me And I realize the joke is on me hey!  I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been 'Til you put me down oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah) Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh oh trouble trouble trouble Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  And the saddest fear comes creeping in That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah  I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been) 'Til you put me down oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there) So shame on me now (Knew it right there) Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh) Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh oh trouble trouble trouble Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  I knew you were trouble when you walked in Trouble trouble trouble I knew you were trouble when you walked in Trouble trouble trouble
Taylor Swift,The Other Side Of The Door,In the heat of the fight I walked away Ignoring words that you were saying Trying to make me stay I said This time I've had enough. And you've called a hundred times But I'm not picking up  'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over But if you look a little closer  I said Leave but all I really want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming I'm in love with you. Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door  Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone Going through the photographs staring at the phone I keep going back over things we both said And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread  So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming I'm in love with you. Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door  And I'll scream out the window I can't even look at you! I don't need you but I do I do I do I say There's nothing you can say to make this right again I mean it I mean it. What I mean is  I said Leave but baby all I want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming I'm in love with you. Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door  With your face and the beautiful eyes And the conversation with the little white lies And the faded picture of a beautiful night You carried me from your car up the stairs And I broke down crying was she worth this mess? After everything and that little black dress After everything I must confess I need you
Taylor Swift,Last Kiss,I still remember the look on your face Lit through the darkness at 1:58 The words that you whispered For just us to know You told me you loved me So why did you go away? Away  I do recall now the smell of the rain Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane That July 9th The beat of your heart It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms  But now I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss Never imagined we'd end like this Your name forever the name on my lips  I do remember the swing of your step The life of the party you're showing off again And I roll my eyes and then You pull me in I'm not much for dancing But for you I did  Because I love your handshake meeting my father I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions  And I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name forever the name on my lips  So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are Hope it's nice where you are  And I hope the sun shines And it's a beautiful day And something reminds you You wish you had stayed You can plan for a change in weather and time But I never planned on you changing your mind  So I'll go sit on the floor Wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name forever the name on my lips  Just like our last kiss Forever the name on my lips Forever the name on my lips  Just like our last
Taylor Swift,Fearless,There's somethin' 'bout the way The street looks when it's just rained There's a glow off the pavement You walk me to the car And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there In the middle of the parking lot Yeah Oh yeah  We're drivin' down the road I wonder if you know I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now But you're just so cool Run your hands through your hair Absentmindedly makin' me want you  And I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first Fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless  So baby drive slow 'Til we run out of road in this one horse town I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat You put your eyes on me In this moment now capture it remember it  'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first Fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless  Well you stood there with me in the doorway My hands shake I'm not usually this way But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave It's the first kiss It's flawless Really something It's fearless  Oh yeah  'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first Fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless  'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first Fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress Fearless  Oh-oh Oh yeah
Taylor Swift,Long Live,I said remember this moment In the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild  We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew Our lives would never be the same  You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  I said remember this feeling I pass the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now  We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town  And the cynics were outraged Screaming This is absurd! 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall  Will you take a moment Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if God forbid fate should step in  And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell them my name  Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine  Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you  Long long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Singing long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered
Taylor Swift,Mine,You were in college working part-time waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  I say Can you believe it? As we're lying on the couch The moment I could see it Yes yes I can see it now  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes yes this is what I thought about  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  And I remember that fight Two-thirty AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the Goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said I'll never leave you alone.  You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine.  Hold on make it last Hold on never turn back  (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine  (Hold on) Yeah yeah Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now (Hold on) And I can see it (Yes yes) I can see it now (see it now see it now)

Long live the king! One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was a wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?

Coldplay,Violet Hill,It was a long and dark December From the rooftops I remember There was snow white snow  Clearly I remember From the windows they were watching While we froze down below  When the future's architectured By a carnival of idiots on show You'd better lie low  If you love me won't you let me know?  Was a long and dark December When the banks became cathedrals And a fox became God  Priests clutched onto Bibles Hollowed out to fit their rifles And a cross was held aloft  Bury me in armour When I'm dead and hit the ground My nerves are poles that unfroze  And if you love me won't you let me know?  I don't want to be a soldier Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow far below  So if you love me why d'you let me go?  I took my love down to Violet Hill There we sat in snow All that time she was silent still  Said if you love me won't you let me know? If you love me won't you let me know?

Look up I look up at night Planets are moving at the speed of light Climb up up in the trees Every chance that you get is a chance you seize  How long am I gonna stand With my head stuck under the sand? I'll start before I can stop But before I see things the right way up  All that noise and all that sound All those places I got found And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began Birds came flying from the underground If you could see it then you'd understand  Ideas that you'll never find All the inventors could never design The buildings that you put up Japan and China all lit up  The sign that I couldn't read Or a light that I couldn't see Some things you have to believe But others are puzzles puzzling me  All that noise and all that sound All those places I got found And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began  Birds came flying from the underground If you could see it then you'd understand Ah when you see it then you'll understand  All those signs— I knew what they meant Some things you can invent Some get made and some get sent Ooh  And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began Birds came flying from the underground If you could see it then you'd understand Ah when you see it then you'll understand

Michael Jackson,Scared Of The Moon,Alone she lays waiting Surrounded by gloom Invaded by shadows Painting the room The light from the window Cuts through the air And pins the child lying there Scared of the moon  She pulls up the covers And shivers in fright She hides from the color That rides on the night The light through the window That lights up the sky And causes her mournful cry Scared of the moon  There's nothing wrong Don't be bothered they said It's just childish fantasies turning your head No need to worry It's really too soon But there she lies shivering Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon  The years go by swiftly And soon childhood ends But life is still fearful When evening descends The fear of a child Still intrudes the night Returning on beams of light Scared of the moon  The feeling of terror She felt as a youth Has turned from a fantasy Into the truth The moon is the enemy Twisting her soul And taking its fearful toll Scared of the moon  But now there are others who sit in a room And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom Together they gather Their lunacy shade But knowing just why they're scared Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon

Michael Jackson,Childhood,Have you seen my childhood? I'm searching for the world that I come from 'Cause I've been looking around In the lost and found of my heart No one understands me They view it as such strange eccentricities 'Cause I keep kidding 'round Like a child but pardon me  People say I'm not okay 'Cause I love such elementary things It's been my fate to compensate For the childhood I've never known  Have you seen my childhood? I'm searching for that wonder in my youth Like pirates in adventurous dreams Of conquest and kings on the throne  Before you judge me try hard to love me Look within your heart then ask Have you seen my childhood?  People say I'm strange that way 'Cause I love such elementary things It's been my fate to compensate For the childhood (Childhood) I've never known  Have you seen my childhood?
