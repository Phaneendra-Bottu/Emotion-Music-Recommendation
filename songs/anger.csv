Ed Sheeran,Asshole,I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth. I smacked a girl Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull Then screamed ICP in this bitch! I was countin' on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history well goddamn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth There's no place you can hide you are just an asshole
Ed Sheeran,Hello,Hello Allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady It's so nice to meet you It's been a long time I'm sorry I've been away so long. You see that chick in the gym checking me out? Any second I'm 'bout To stick her neck in my mouth I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house.
Ed Sheeran,Cleanin Out My Closet,Eminem's new album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is out now. The rapper has been protested and demonstrated against for his rhymes. I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it he says.
Ed Sheeran,Almost Famous,I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist. I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker I murk her with a Mossberg This may be the last chance I get to be famous (I just wanna be famous)  You dream of trading places I have been changing faces You cannot fill these shoes There is too much to lose
Ed Sheeran,My Dad's Gone Crazy,Eminem: There's no mountain I can't climb Hailie: My dad's lost it Eminem: I'm going to Hell who's comin' with me? I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch eat pussy
Ed Sheeran,Square Dance,I'm back now I've come to release this info I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim? No! Not even on my radar So won't you please jump off my dick Lay off and stay off And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance There's nothin' you can do to me Stab me Shoot me Psychotic Hypnotic product I got the antibiotic Ain't nobody hotter
Ed Sheeran,Criminal,A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions. If you believe that then I'll kill you 'Cause I'm a criminal. My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge That'll stab you in the head Whether you're a fag or lez Or a homosex hermaph or a trans-a-vest Pants or dress Hate fags? The answer's yes.
Ed Sheeran,Love The Way You Lie,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts. I love the way you lie  I just want her back I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to leave again I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire.
Ed Sheeran,Untitled,(You don't own me. Don't try to change me) Nah man Not quite finished yet  Girl I think You just might've tried to pull a motherfucking fast one I'm mad You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games? See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker In your walk-way? Better co-operate Or get saut√©ed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied MCs get so quiet you can hear a mother fucking dog whistle when I walk by 'Colt Seavers' on a mule stunting on that ass.
Ed Sheeran,Love Game,I'm in somethin' but I don't know how to get outta Left my girl in the house alone is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further I walk the louder I told her: go where you wanna go go do what 'cha wanna do IDon't care I told that bitch  I'm a sucker for love you're a suckerfor dick We're gonna get married still? Fucking Mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
Taylor Swift,Better Than Revenge,She took him faster than you could say sabotage Stealing other people's toys on the playground won't make you many friends There is nothing I do better than revenge She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
Taylor Swift,Picture To Burn,State the obvious I didn't get my perfect fantasy I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay! By the way...  I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn!  There's no time for tears I'm just sitting here planning my revenge There's nothing stopping me From going out with all of your best friends And if you come around saying sorry to me My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn!  And if you're missing me You'd better keep it to yourself 'Cause coming back around here Would be bad for your health...  'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time In case you haven't heard I really really hate that...  Stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn!  Burn burn burn baby burn You're just another picture to burn Baby burn...

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up. (Yeah yeah yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
