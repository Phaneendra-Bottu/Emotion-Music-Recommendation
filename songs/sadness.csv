Ed Sheeran,Beautiful,Eminem's new single Rock Therapy is out now. The rapper has been struggling with depression. He says he's been too long on his own and needs a new outlet. The song is about reaching out to people who are in similar situations.
Ed Sheeran,When I'm Gone,When I'm gone just carry on don't mourn I keep having this dream I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing Sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat Put it to my brain and scream it The cockens my life
Ed Sheeran,When The Music Stops,Eminem: 'If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow would you feel sorrow or show love? Or would it matter? Could never be the lead-off batter If there ain't shit for me to feed off I'm see-saw battlin' There's too much on my plate I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away And not say what I got to say'
Eminem,Be Like You,One two three  Unhappy days That left us on the floor And you squeeze me Till you're not feeling sure Everything will brighten up if we go to Brighton I'll Take you along the pier Everything will lighten up and if you feel too frightened I'll Make things disappear dear  Darling don't be nervous I'll understand if you let me go I did this on purpose Now 'cause when I'm missing you  I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness And why you're leaving too maybe I'll put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you  Sunny days That left my skin dark red And you breathe me Till these thoughts leave my head If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated Can you see what's wrong? If you feel like you've been jaded and this love's too overrated See what's going on  And darling don't be nervous I'll understand if you let me go I did this on purpose Now 'cause when I'm missing you  I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness And why you're leaving too maybe I'll put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you  Take me back to live at home Take me back to Albert Road  'Cause when I'm missing you I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness And why you left too I thought I'd put you to a test And say that I love you I think that I love you And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness And why you left me too I thought I'd put you to a test And say that I love you now it seems you loved me too
Eminem,Bibia Be Ye Ye,Bibia Be Ye Ye (everything will be alright) I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams My heart is breaking at the seams And I'm coming apart now.
Eminem,Save Myself,I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe I gave away my money and now we don't even speak I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me Oh honestly?  Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song It goes on and on  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same? And only scars remain  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger Just because they needed saving just like that Oh I'm here again between the devil and the danger But I guess it's just my nature My dad was wrong cause I'm not like my mum Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song but it helps So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself And before I blame someone else I've got to save myself And before I love someone else I've got to love myself
Eminem,Goodbye To You,I owe my life to you. I was just too young to go on with it There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you
Eminem,Photograph,Loving can hurt Loving can hurt sometimes But it's the only thing that I know When it gets hard You know it can get hard sometimes It is the only thing that makes us feel alive  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Hearts are never broken Times forever frozen still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket Of your ripped jeans Holding me closer 'Til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone Wait for me to come home  Loving can heal Loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know (know) I swear it will get easier Remember that with every piece of ya And it's the only thing we take with us when we die  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Hearts were never broken Times forever frozen still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket Of your ripped jeans Holding me closer 'Til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone  And if you hurt me That's OK baby only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me And I won't ever let you go  Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home  Oh you can fit me Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen Next to your heartbeat Where I should be Keep it deep within your soul  And if you hurt me Well that's OK baby only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me And I won't ever let you go  When I'm away I will remember how you kissed me Under the lamppost Back on 6th street Hearing you whisper through the phone Wait for me to come home
Eminem,Sing,I want you to be mine lady To hold your body close Take another step into the no-man's land For the longest time lady  I need you darling Come on set the tone If you feel you're falling Won't you let me know?
Eminem,Castle On The Hill,When I was six years old I broke my leg I was running from my brother and his friends And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down  I was younger then Take me back to when  I found my heart and broke it here Made friends and lost them through the years And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long I know I've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to Tiny Dancer And I miss the way You make me feel And it's real When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends Had my first kiss on a Friday night I don't reckon that I did it right  I was younger then Take me back to when  We found weekend jobs when we got paid We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long Oh how we've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way Driving at 90 down those country lanes Singing to Tiny Dancer And I miss the way You make me feel And it's real When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill  One friend left to sell clothes One works down by the coast One had two kids but lives alone One's brother overdosed One's already on his second wife One's just barely getting by But these people raised me And I can't wait to go home  And I'm on my way I still remember these old country lanes When we did not know the answers And I miss the way You make me feel And it's real When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill
Eminem,Let It Out,You give me life Like lots of oxygen You treat me like I was in love again And I hold you tight Tight enough to know That you are mine I'd never let you go  And it's you I miss And it's you I miss So let it out And let it out now And let it out And let it out now now  And you speak to me Behind your dark green stare And you let me be As if I wasn't there  It seemed perfect The concept Free from any regret Another couple based on teen sex You idiot true I was just like you We couldn't be torn apart You see we were just like glue  It's you I miss And it's you I miss So let it out And let it out now And let it out And let it out now now.  It seemed perfect The concept Free from any regret Another couple based on teen sex You idiot true I was just like you We couldn't be torn part You see we were just like glue  We're like glue  So let it out Let it out now Let it out And let it out now now  It seemed perfect The concept Free from any regret Another couple based on teen sex You idiot true I was just like you We couldn't be torn apart You see we were just like glue
Eminem,Sunburn,You’re not her Though I try to see you differently I tow the line You see I’m searching for what used to be mine  I saw your eyes And then I saw her staring back at me And I will try to find another one Who suited me as well as her  I've moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me dear But things aren’t clear  When we never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I’d miss you I miss you  She was mine I was hers And all that’s in between If she would cry I would shelter her And keep her from the darkness that will be  If I moved far away from you And I want to see you here beside me dear But things aren’t clear  We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I’d miss you And I miss you  Don’t drop me in It’s not my turn If you cut deep Then I might learn If you scar and leave me Like a sunburn  Don’t drop me in It’s not my turn If you cut deep Then I might learn You scarred and left me Like a sunburn  We never even tried We never even talked We never even thought in the long run Whenever it was painful Whenever I was away I’d miss you I miss you
Eminem,Eraser,I was born inside a small town I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the lord's house But stopped at the age of nine I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride. Save your loving arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser  I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs.
Eminem,Kiss Me,One two three four  Settle down with me Cover me up Cuddle me in  Lie down with me And hold me in your arms  And your heart's against my chest your lips pressed to my neck I'm falling for your eyes but they don't know me yet And with a feeling I'll forget I'm in love now  Kiss me like you wanna be loved You wanna be loved You wanna be loved This feels like falling in love Falling in love We're falling in love  Settle down with me And I'll be your safety You'll be my lady  I was made to keep your body warm But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms  Oh no My heart's against your chest your lips pressed to my neck I'm falling for your eyes but they don't know me yet And with this feeling I'll forget I'm in love now  Kiss me like you wanna be loved You wanna be loved You wanna be loved This feels like falling in love Falling in love We're falling in love  Yeah I've been feeling everything From hate to love From love to lust From lust to truth I guess that's how I know you So I hold you close to help you give it up  So kiss me like you wanna be loved You wanna be loved You wanna be loved This feels like falling in love Falling in love We're falling in love  Kiss me like you wanna be loved You wanna be loved You wanna be loved This feels like falling in love Falling in love We're falling in love
Eminem,Runaway,I've known it for a long time Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine Disappearing all night I don't wanna know where he's been lying I know what I wanna do Wanna run away run away with you Gonna grab clothes six in the morning go  How long you leaving? Well dad just don't expect me back this evening Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this It's been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just run away and be on my own  I've never seen my dad cry Cold as stone in the kitchen light I'll tell you it's about time But I was raised to keep quiet This is what I'm gonna do Gonna run away gonna make that move Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning go How long you leaving? Well dad just don't expect me back this evening Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this It's been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just run away and be on my own  Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back As I packed my clothes up My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack intends to show love  I don't wanna live this way Gonna take my things and go If things change in a matter of days I could be persuaded to hold on Mama was the same None of us are saints I guess that God knows that I don't wanna run away And one of these days I might just show that Put my home in a suitcase Tie both shoe laces and hope that Things change but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder  I love him from my skin to my bones But I don't wanna live in his home There's nothing to say 'cause he knows I'll just run away and be on my own
Eminem,The A Team,White lips pale face Breathing in snowflakes Burnt lungs sour taste Light's gone day's end Struggling to pay rent Long nights strange men  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly  Ripped gloves raincoat Tried to swim and stay afloat Dry house wet clothes Loose change bank notes Weary-eyed dry throat Call girl no phone  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And she don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly An angel will die Covered in white Closed eye And hoping for a better life This time we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line  And they say She's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries They scream The worst things in life come free to us And we're all under the upper hand Go mad for a couple grams And we don't want to go outside tonight And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland Or sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly To fly fly For angels to fly to fly to fly For angels to die
Eminem,Supermarket Flowers,I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill I threw the day-old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that's been loved  Took the Get Well Soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink Dad always told me Don't you cry when you're down But mom there's a tear every time that I blink  Oh I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go And when God takes you back He'll say Hallelujah you're home  I fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face  And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know A life with love is a life that's been lived  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go  When God takes you back He'll say Hallelujah you're home  Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become Spread your wings and I know That when God took you back he said Hallelujah you're home
Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,I remember when we broke up the first time Saying This is it I've had enough 'cause like We hadn't seen each other in a month When you said you needed space.

Taylor Swift,Back To December,I'm so glad you made time to see me How's life? Tell me how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while  You've been good busier than ever We small-talk work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why  Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right I go back to December all the time  These days I haven't been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call  And I think about summer all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side And realized I loved you in the fall  And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I go back to December all the time  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  I miss your tanned skin your sweet smile So good to me so right And how you held me in your arms that September night: The first time you ever saw me cry  Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right  I'd go back in time and change it but I can't So if the chain is on your door I understand  But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I go back to December  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind  I go back to December all the time All the time
Taylor Swift,The Last Time,[Gary Lightbody:] I find myself at your door Just like all those times before I'm not sure how I got there All roads—they lead me here  I imagine you are home In your room all alone And you open your eyes into mine And everything feels better  [Both:] And right before your eyes I'm breaking no past No reasons why Just you and me  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye  [Taylor Swift:] You find yourself at my door Just like all those times before You wear your best apology But I was there to watch you leave  And all the times I let you in Just for you to go again Disappear when you come back Everything is better  [Both:] And right before your eyes I'm aching no past Nowhere to hide Just you and me  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye  This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong This is the last time I say it's been you all along This is the last time I let you in my door This is the last time I won't hurt you anymore  Oh oh oh  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye  This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty Is the face in the mirror looking back at you You walk around here thinking you're not pretty But that's not true 'cause I know you  Hold on baby you're losing it The water's high you're jumping into it And letting go And no one knows That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  I guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change Hoping it will end up in his pocket But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain  Oh 'cause it's not his price to pay It's not his price to pay  Hold on baby you're losing it The water's high you're jumping into it And letting go And no one knows That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  Hold on baby you're losing it The water's high you're jumping into it And letting go And no one knows That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  You're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone Goodbye baby With a smile baby baby
Taylor Swift,Change,And it's a sad picture The final blow hits you Somebody else gets what you wanted again And you know it's all the same Another time and place Repeating history and you're getting sick of it  But I believe in whatever you do And I'll do anything to see it through  Because these things will change Can you feel it now? These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down This revolution the time will come For us to finally win And we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah Oh oh  So we've been outnumbered Raided and now cornered It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair We're getting stronger now Find things they never found They might be bigger But we're faster and never scared  You can walk away say we don't need this But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this  'Cause these things will change Can you feel it now?

Taylor Swift,Love Story,We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air  See the lights see the party the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say Hello. Little did I know  That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet. And I was crying on the staircase Begging you Please don't go. And I said  Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while Oh oh  'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet. But you were everything to me I was begging you Please don't go! And I said  Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'  Romeo save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel This love is difficult but it's real Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  Oh oh oh  I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said  Romeo save me. I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  Marry me Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

Ariana Grande,My Everything,I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them And then it was clear I can't deny I really miss it  To think that I was wrong I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone Pain is just a consequence of love I'm saying Sorry for the sake of us  He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing And it's taking me a lot to say But now that he's gone my heart is missing something So it's time I push my pride away 'Cause you are You are You are my everything You are You are You are my everything  I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance You're travelling with my heart I hope this is a temporary feeling 'Cause it's too much to bear Without you and I know Sorry ain't the cure If I cross your mind just know I'm yours 'Cause what we got is worth fighting for 'Cause you are...

Maroon 5,Back At Your Door,From the moment the lights went off Everything had changed Lie awake in an empty room In my head it all feels the same  Like the taste of the day you left That still lingers on my breath And the dampness of tears that left A stain where you had wept  All alone with the negligee That still hangs off of my bed I keep meaning to give it away But I just leave it there instead  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Three more days 'til I see your face I'm afraid it's far too much Cook a meal and fix up the place Dial your number hang it up  If I took you for granted I apologize for acting tough You're my reason for living And there's no way I'm giving up oh  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me?

Moving on down my street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.  The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me  Hate to love and love to hate her Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone And on and on and on and on  I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles—.

Michael Jackson,Little Susie,Somebody killed little Susie The girl with the tune Who sings in the daytime at noon She was there screaming Beating her voice in her doom But nobody came to her soon...  A fall down the stairs Her dress torn Oh the blood in her hair... A mystery so sullen in air She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  Everyone came to see The girl that now is dead So blind stare the eyes in her head... And suddenly a voice from the crowd said This girl lived in vain Her face bear such agony such strain...  But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried As he reached down To close Susie's eyes... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  It was all for God's sake For her singing the tune For someone to feel her despair To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed Then to scream out And nobody's there...  She knew no one cared...  Father left home poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather's soul too had flown... No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear Rejecting the needs in her prayers...  Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care So young and so fair

Eminem,Drunk,I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed And never an excuse I made up Tell you the truth I hate What didn't kill me It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your make up Lips sticks to me so now I maybe lean back there I'm sat here wishing I was sober I know I'll never hold you like I used to  But a house gets cold when you cut the heating Without you to hold I'll be freezing Can't rely on my heart to beat in 'Cause you take parts of it every evening Take words out of my mouth just from breathing Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '  Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love  I wanna hold your heart in both hands Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can And I got no plans for the weekend so should we speak then? Keep it between friends Though I know you'll never love me like you used to  There may be other people like us Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before And you don't hold me anymore  On cold days cold plays out like the band's name I know I can't heal things with a handshake You know I can change as I began saying You cut me wide open like landscape Open bottles of beer but never champagne To applaud you with the sound that my hands make  Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love  All by myself I'm here again All by myself you know I'll never change All by myself All by myself  I'm just drunk again I'll be drunk again I'll be drunk again To feel a little love,sadness

Taylor Swift,Should've Said No,It's strange to think the songs we used to sing The smiles the flowers everything is gone Yesterday I found out about you Even now just looking at you feels wrong  You say that you'd take it all back given one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes.  You should've said No you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd Get back to me (get back to me). And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself Why? You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet... You should've said No baby and you might still have me  You can see that I've been crying And baby you know all the right things to say But do you honestly expect me to believe We could ever be the same?  You say that the past is the past you need one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes.  You should've said No you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd Get back to me (get back to me). And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself Why? You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet... You should've said No baby and you might still have me  I can't resist Before you go tell me this: Was it worth it? Was she worth this?  No... no no no...  You should've said No you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd Get back to me (get back to me).
