Artist Name,Song Name,Sum Lyrics
Ed Sheeran,So Far...,I own a mansion but live in a house A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch I'm Mister Bright Side glass is half-full But my tank's half empty gasket just blew  This always happens Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin only option I have's McDonald's' bathroom In a public stall droppin' a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened Shady.
Ed Sheeran,Stan,Eminem as Stan: My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like
Ed Sheeran,3 A.M.,It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em) It's almost noon I wonder what's on the tube Maybe they'll show some boobs Surfin' every channel until I find Hannah Montana.
Eminem,Homeless,Mmm... Whoa oh...  Could I wake up next to you When it's hitting double figures Look into your eyes Like I'm looking into double mirrors Could you make it any clearer Everything's such a blur It's not my turn It's hers to get hurt On a late night Coming home from way too many train rides.
Taylor Swift,Blank Space,Nice to meet you where you been? I could show you incredible things Magic madness heaven sin Saw you there and I thought Oh my God look at that face You look like my next mistake Love's a game wanna play? Ayy  New money suit and tie I can read you like a magazine Ain't it funny? Rumors fly And I know you heard about me So hey let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Taylor Swift,Begin Again,Took a deep breath in the mirror He didn't like it when I wore high heels But I do Turn the lock and put my headphones on He always said he didn't get this song But I do I do  Walked in expecting you'd be late But you got here early and you stand and wave I walk to you You pull my chair out and help me in And you don't know how nice that is But I do  And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  You said you never met one girl Who had as many James Taylor records as you But I do We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy But I do  But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did  I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up But you start to talk about the movies that your family Watches Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that And for the first time what's past is past  'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months  Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Taylor Swift,Bette Davis Eyes,There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA did you know that? Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I'm such a fan of and I'd love to play you some music that I'm a fan of that's come from LA is that okay? This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song. It's called Bette Davis Eyes  Her hair is Harlow gold Her lips sweet surprise Her hands are never cold She's got Bette Davis eyes  She'll turn her music on You won't have to think twice She's pure as New York snow She's got Bette Davis eyes  And she'll tease you She'll unease you All the better just to please you She's precocious and she knows just What it takes to make a pro blush She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs She's got Bette Davis eyes  She'll let you take her home It whets her appetite She'll lay you on her throne She's got Bette Davis eyes  She'll expose you And just knows you Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you She's ferocious and she knows just What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy ayy) All the boys think she's a spy She's got Bette Davis eyes
Taylor Swift,I Want You Back,Ooh baby give me one more chance (I'll show you that I love you) Oh won't you please let me Back in your heart?
