###"Hey Angel"###

Hey angel
Do you know the reasons why
We look up to the sky?
Hey angel
Do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past?
Hey angel

Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever try
To come to the other side?
Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever cry
When we waste away our lives?

Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh I wish I could be more like you
Oh I wish I could be more, I could be more, I could be more

Yeah I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
Yeah I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise

Hey angel
Hey angel
Do you look up to the sky?
Do you look up to the sky?

Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

Hey angel
Hey angel

###"One Thing"###

[Liam:]
I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race

[Harry:]
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

[Zayn:]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

[Niall:]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

[Louis:]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Harry:]
You've got that one thing

[Liam:]
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

[Chorus:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my mind (out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
Yeah, you've got that one thing

###"Wolves"###

[Harry:]
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Liam and Louis:]
I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

[Niall:]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
You got the whole world shaking

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I gotta take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Liam, Niall and Louis:]
I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know

It's bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

[Liam:]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't enough for the taking
We got the whole world shaking

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I gotta take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Niall and Liam:]
I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

[Harry:]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

###"Why Don't We Go There"###

I know you want, know you wanna take it slow
But think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight
Just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side,
Just give me the key

'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way.
Why don't you go there with me?

Say the word, say the word but don't say "No"
Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes
The secret's safe with me
There's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see
We'll do it anyway

'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way.
Why don't you go there with me?

Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind,
I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say "No"
Just let go

'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride (let's take a ride)
Out in the cold air
I know the way (I know the way).
Why don't you go there with me?

With me, with me
Why don't you go there with me?

###"I Want"###

[Harry]
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

[Harry]
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Liam]
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Louis]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[Zayn]
Be loved by you
I wanna, I’ll stay true
I wonder if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

[Liam]
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

[Zayn]
Oh, and all the girls say…

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
But that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
And that's not me
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Louis]
To be loved by you

[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Harry]
And all the girls say
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
[Zayn]
And that's crazy
[All]
I want, I want, I want,
To be loved by you

###"Gotta Be You"###

[Liam:]
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

[Harry:]
Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

[Liam:]
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where

[Zayn:]
I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away
I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

[Zayn:]
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time
I'll make it better
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

[Harry:]
'Cause it's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Only you
Only you

It's gotta be you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you

###"Half A Heart"###

So your friends been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
'Cause I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

Only half a blue sky
(Only half a blue sky)
Kind of there but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you

I'm half a man at best
(Half a man at best)
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Without you, without you
Half a heart without you
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without you

###"Little Things"###

[Zayn:]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me...

[Liam:]
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs 
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Zayn & Liam:]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
It's you
Oh it's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Louis:]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me

[Harry:]
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh 
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Harry & Niall:]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Niall:]
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darlin' but I want you to
If I let you know I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Harry:]
I've just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you
Oh it's you
It's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Everyone:]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if it's true
It's you
It's you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all your little things

###"End Of The Day"###

[Harry:]
I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

[Niall:]
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Liam:]
Said the night was over, I said it's forever
20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But girl it's only you

[Louis:]
I said you're on fire babe then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Louis:]
When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

[Harry:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you'll follow your heart even though it'll break
Sometimes

[All:]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learnt from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

###"Through The Dark"###

You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hiding
And I just wanna see ya

You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again

But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'd be there to hold ya

You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you were laughing
So let's just laugh again

But don't burn out even
If you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
Back to you

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

And you don't need, you don't need to run
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved

Oh, I will carry you over fire and water for your love

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark

Oh, I would carry you over fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way through the dark

###"Drag Me Down"###

[Harry:]
I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason

[Louis:]
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

[Liam:]
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Niall:]
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Chorus:]
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

[Niall:]
I got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason

[Harry:]
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left (nothing left)
The shell of a man who could never be his best (be his best)
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun (see the sun)
You taught me how to be someone
Yeah

[Niall:]
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Chorus:]
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me

[Liam:]
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Niall:]
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

[Chorus:]
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

###"Still The One"###

[Liam:]
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while
But, baby, I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know, oh, oh, oh

[Louis:]
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

[All:]
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one

[Niall:]
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl, just tell me what I wanna hear

[Harry:]
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said, yeah
I can't get it out of my head, yeah

Now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

[All:]
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one

Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you-

[Harry:]
You're still the one

[All:]
I know it's saying too much (Yeah)
But I will never give up (C'mon)
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one

###"Over Again"###

Said I'd never leave her
Cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that made my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low
Since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say
If I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute
You know I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip (yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss
Everything you said to me
And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit, like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

###"Perfect"###

[Louis:]
I might never be your knight in shining armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

[Liam:]
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious
Oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Harry, All:]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Niall:]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

[Liam:]
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious
Oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Harry, All:]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Harry:]
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
Oh, yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your break-up songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect

[Harry, All:]
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

###"What A Feeling"###

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance
Dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Whatever chains are holding you back
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever change is holding you back
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now
I wish I could be there now

###"Temporary Fix"###

Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl that's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody but he doesn't know what you like

You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see's you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked on anything right now, I can be your vice

All you need to know is

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
I'm your good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me and we'll call this what you like

Let me be your good night

The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body is saying everything, I don't have to read your mind

Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off, now we're taking it off tonight

All you need to know is

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
I'm your good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me and we'll call this what you like

Let me be your good night

We can roll in the darkness,
Let me touch you where your heart is
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well, I told you, baby, that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
I'm your good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

###"Diana"###

Diana
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Liam:]
The front pages are your pictures,
They make you look so small,
How could someone not miss you at all?

(Oh-ah-oh)

[Harry:]
I never would mistreat ya,
Oh I'm not a criminal,
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.

[All:]

I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.

(Oh-oh)

[Zayn:]

It's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far.
How could someone mislead you at all?

I wanna break these walls,
I speak a different language but I still hear you call.

Swear I'd never put you down.

[All:]

###"Loved You First"###

[Zayn:]
Girl, that should be me driving to your house,
Knocking on your door, kissing you on the mouth,

[Liam:]
Holding on your hand, dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start.

[Harry:]
But now when I see you with him it tears my world apart.

[All:]
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse.
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first.

[Louis:]
Girl, that should be me calling on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go.

[Harry:]
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes.

[Liam:]
But now when I see you with him my whole world falls apart.

[All:]
Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse.
Baby, I loved you first.
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first.

[Zayn:]
First touch (first touch), first kiss (first kiss),
First girl who made me feel like this (like this)
Heartbreak (heartbreak), it's killing me (k-k-killin' me),
I loved you first – why can't you see?

[Niall:]
I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken,
Nothing could be worse.

[Zayn:]
Baby, I loved you first.

[All:]
Had my chances,
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most.
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know,
Baby, I loved you first

[Zayn:]
Baby, I loved you first.
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah.

[Harry:]
Baby I loved you first.

###"Fool's Gold"###

I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly, home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time

But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

And, yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see
Two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

And, yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

And, yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

###"Best Song Ever"###

[Harry:]
Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it

[Zayn:]
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...

[Liam:]
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist

[Harry:]
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Niall:]
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

[All:]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

(oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Zayn:]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced
How we danced
1, 2, 1, 2, 3

[All:]
How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(we danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)
Danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah

[Zayn:]
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever

###"Change My Mind"###

The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone’s gone

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I’ll change my mind.

Lean in when you laugh,
We take photographs
There’s no music on
But we dance along

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure.

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I’ll change my mind.

I’ll change my mind.

Baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind

But, baby, if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I’ll change my mind.

###"Right Now"###

Lights go down, and the night is calling to me, yeah.
I hear voices singing songs in the street

And I know that we won't be going home for so long, for so long.
But I know that I won't be on my own, yeah.

I love this feeling and right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now,
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.

Late night spaces with all our friends, you and me, yeah.
Love these faces just like how it used to be.

And we won't be going home for so long, for so long.
But I know, I won't be on my own, on my own.

I'm feeling like right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now.
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.

And I could do this forever.
Whoa, whoa.
And let's go crazy together.
Whoa, whoa.

Lights go down and I hear you calling to me, yeah.

Right now
I wish you were here with me
Cause right now
Everything is new to me.
You know I can't fight the feeling.
And every night I feel it.
Right now
I wish you were here with me.

###"I Wish"###

(Na na na na na) [2x]

He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

(Na na na na na)

When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

(Na na na na na) [2x]

He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things,
I know, that I could
If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you’ll call later on
'Cause you wanna say good night

'Cause I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see

But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish that was me

Oh how I wish that was me

###"Ready To Run"###

[Harry:]
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat running out of time
Without you I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright

[Liam:]
There's a devil in your smile, that's chasing me
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know, that I'll be fine

[Chorus:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from this city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

[Niall:]
There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me

[Louis:]
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright

[Chorus:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from this city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run

[Zayn:]
This time I'm ready to run (ready to run)
I'll give everything that I got for your love

[Harry:]
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from this city and follow the sun

[All:]
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run (this time I'm ready to run)
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run

###"More Than This"###

[Liam:]
Ooh
I'm broken, do you hear me?
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see,
I'm dancin' alone, I'm praying,
That your heart will just turn around,

And as I walk up to your door,
My head turns to face the floor,
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say,

[Harry:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this

[Niall:]
If I'm louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same
You save me,
When you leave it's gone again,

[Louis:]
And then I see you on the street,
In his arms, I get weak,
My body fails, I'm on my knees
Prayin',

[All:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn:]
Yeah, I've never had the words to say,
But now I'm askin' you to stay
For a little while inside my arms,
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
That's shining from the stars above,

(And I say)

[Liam:]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,

[Zayn]
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

[All]
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he lays you down,
I might just die inside (I'm broken)
It just don't feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this

###"Love You Goodbye"###

It's inevitable everything that's good comes to an end
It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah

I know you're saying you don't wanna hurt me
Well, maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look I know you didn't come to apologize

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands
Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah

I know there's nothing I can do to change it
But is it something that can be negotiated?
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on, twist the knife

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

One more taste of your lips just to bring me back
To the places we've been and the nights we've had
Because if this is it then at least we could end it right

Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay the night, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

###"Story Of My Life"###

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

###"Does He Know?"###

He knows about you in every way
He's memorized every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know

Your secret tattoo
The way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favorite band
The way that you dance
But, baby, baby

Does he know you can move it like that?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Tonight you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know?

I catch your eye then you turn away
But there's no hiding the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around, girl, you let me know

Your secret tattoo
The way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
He knows how you dance
In front of your friends
But, baby, baby

Does he know you can move it like that?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Tonight you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know?

He'll never know
The way you lie when you look at me
So, keep trying but you know I see
All the little things that make you who you are
So tell me, girl

Does he know you can move it like that (like that, like that)?
Does he know that you'll never go back (go back, go back)?

Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Does he know you can move it like that?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Tonight you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Does he know?

###"No Control"###

Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on pillowcase

Waking up
Beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control, no control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are closed
No control

Taste on my tongue
I don't wanna wash away the night before
In the heat where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control, no control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devour
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control, no control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedals down, my eyes are closed
No control

No control
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

###"You & I"###

[Niall:]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

[Liam:]
I know how it goes
I know how it goes for wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other
Tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Harry:]
You & I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You & I
Oh, you & I

[Zayn:]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

[Louis:]
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us
They never tried like us

[Harry:]
You & I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us

[Zayn:]
'Cause you & I
[All:]
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you & I
Not even the gods above
Could separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You & I

[Zayn:]
You & I

[Harry:]
Oh, you & I [x2]

[Zayn:]
We can make it if we try
You & I

[Harry:]
Oh, you & I
You & I

###"Little White Lies"###

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say it's getting late
It's getting late
And you don't know if you can stay
If you can stay.

But you, you don't tell the truth
No you, you like playing games

Your hands touching me, they're touching me.
And your eyes keep saying things.
They say of what we do
When it's only me and you.
I can't concentrate.

That's all I'm thinking about.
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

Back seat of the cab,
We're in the cab.
My lips getting so attached,
They're so attached.

Now you wanna make some rules
Now cool—then we'll watch them break tonight.

I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

I know you want it
I know you feel it too.
Let's stop pretending.
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do.

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies.
With your little white lies, little white lies.

###"Never Enough"###

Wanna pull an all-nighter
And get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party
The weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth
And go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you
And say baby let's do it all over again

Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on

Wanna pull an all-nighter
And get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party
The weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth
And go over the edge

And say baby let's do it all over again

Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Too much is never enough
Never enough, it's never, it's never, it's never

I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough
I don't need my love
You can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart
You can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
Come on
Come on

Come on

###"Walking In The Wind"###

[Harry:]
A week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
The necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Niall:]
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good times, didn't we?
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

[Harry:]
You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

[Louis:]
Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realized you were missing

[Liam:]
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We had some good times, didn't we?
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
A-ooo-ooo-ooo
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

[Harry:]
You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

[Harry:]
And I know we'll be alright child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me

Oh yeah

[Harry:]
You will find me
Yeah you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

###"Live While We're Young"###

Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too (know it too)
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

(C'mon, young) wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live while we're young
Tonight let's get some

[Zayn:]
And live while we're young

###"Stockholm Syndrome"###

[Harry:]
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?

[Zayn:]
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I feel I'm getting used to
Being held by you

[All:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Louis:]
Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking about your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind

[Niall:]
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[All:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

[Liam:]
All my life I've been on my own
I use a light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

[Harry:]
Baby, look what you've done (done, done)

[All:]
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way, oh o-oh

###"Midnight Memories"###

1, 2, 3

[Harry:]
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
A big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen

[Louis:]
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

[Chorus:]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

[Liam:]
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me
[Niall:]
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day

[Louis:]
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

[Chorus:]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

[Niall:]
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for, oh, oh, oh

[Harry:]
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Anywhere we go never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

###"Girl Almighty"###

(Hey hey, oh no, no, no)

[LIAM:]
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior, oh (whoa whoa whoa)

[HARRY:]
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake,"
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no

[NIALL:]
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

[ZAYN:]
Am I the only, only believer?

There's something happening here [2x]

The only, only believer

(There's something happening here,
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)

[LIAM:]
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees for you
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you

[LOUIS:]
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior, oh (whoa whoa whoa)

[NIALL:]
She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake,"
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no

[HARRY:]
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty

[LOUIS:]
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

[ZAYN:]
Am I the only, only believer?

There's something happening here [2x]

The only, only believer

(There's something happening here,
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too)

[LIAM:]
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees for you

[NIALL:]
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you

###"Little Black Dress"###

Little black dress
Just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn
Can't stop looking at you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know

Little black dress
Did you come here alone?
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to go home

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright you know

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Whoa

Little black dress
Who you doin' it for?
Little black dress
I can't take anymore
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right, you know

Little black dress
What's your favourite song?
Little black dress
I won't do you no harm

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright, you know
It's alright
It's alright
'Cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Whoa oh

[Guitar Break]

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Ooh

###"Don't Forget Where You Belong"###

Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was

On the horizon
Mmm, well, I know, I know, I know, I know the sun will be rising
Back home

Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was

On the horizon
Ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know the moon will be rising
Back home

Don't forget where you belong. Home
Don't forget where you belong. Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory

I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know that I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong. Home
Don't forget where you belong. Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the sky look wrong
Short days but the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone—
I'm always free to run home
Oh

Don't forget where you belong. Home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it). Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
Never, never, never

Don't forget where you belong. Home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it). Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own (you are never)
And the proof is in this song

Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own (you are never)
And the proof is in this song

Never forget it
This song
Don't forget it
No, I'll never forget it
This song
You will never

###"Where Do Broken Hearts Go?"###

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go

So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Try to find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy

Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you never heard enough

Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Try to find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go

Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Try to find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go

Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go

Tell me where you're hiding now
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, 'cause I'm ten feet down
Where do broken hearts go?

Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, come and get me out
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?

###"I Would"###

[Liam:]
Lately I found myself thinking (thinking)
Been dreaming about you a lot (a lot)
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend (boyfriend)
But that's one thing you've already got

[Harry:]
He drives to school every morning (morning)
While I walk alone in the rain (the rain)
He'd kill me without any warning (warning)
If he took a look in my brain

[Zayn:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (I would)

[Zayn:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would

[Niall:]
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying kick me
Reality ruined my life

[Louis:]
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos

[Zayn:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (I would)

[Zayn:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
I would, I would

[Louis:]
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would? (I would)
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?

[Harry:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (I would)

[Louis:]
Would he please you? (Would he please you?)
Would he kiss you? (Would he kiss you?)
Would he treat you like I would? (like I would)
Would he touch you? (Would he touch you?)
Would he need you? (Would he need you?)
Would he love you like I would?

[All:]
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would (I would)
Yes, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would (oh)
I would (yeah), I would (yeah)

###"I Want To Write You A Song"###

[Harry:]
I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song

[Liam:]
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

[Louis:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Liam:]
I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

[Louis:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Harry:]
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, givin' back is all I wanna do

[Niall:]
I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song

###"Night Changes"###

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off

[Liam:]
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Louis:]
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

[Niall:]
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Harry (along all):]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you

###"Tell Me A Lie"###

[Liam]
Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried

[Zayn]
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired

As you break my heart again this time

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he’s what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and...

[Liam] tell me a lie

[Liam]
Well you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time.

[Harry]
And well there must've been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind

[Liam]
As you take what's left of you and I

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and...

Tell me a lie

(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me a lie!

[Chorus:]
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess (mess)
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss (kiss)
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!
Tell me a lie!

###"Happily"###

[Harry:]
You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away

[Niall:]
Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

[Zayn:]
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now

(1, 2, 3)

[All:]

You know I want to be the one who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So come on baby be with me so happily

[Liam:]
It's 4am and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I've touched your skin

[Louis:]
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry, Lord, but I don't really care

[Niall:]
Cause we're on fire, we're all on fire
We're on fire now

[Zayn:]
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire

###"Back For You"###

[Liam:]
Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
I'm looking out at the crowd, you're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
You're hearing me say

[Harry:]
Goodbye.

[All:]
Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you.

[Louis:]

And every time we both touch I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah
Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say

###"Save You Tonight"###

I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh

It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it

All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed

I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman, but for you I'll be super human
I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight

Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
'Cause he don't adore you
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn you

What you want, what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears

I, I want to save you, want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you, leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman, but for you I'll be super human
I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight

Up, up and away, I'll take you with me
Up, up and away, I'll take you with me

I, I want to save you, save you, save you tonight
I want to save you, save you, save you tonight
I want to save you, save you, save you tonight

###"Spaces"###

Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

We keep taking turns
Oho-oho-oh
Will we ever learn

Ooh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye

Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made?

Ooh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why

Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

We keep taking turns
Will we ever learn?
When will we learn?

Ooh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I try
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

(The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us)

###"Strong"###

My hands
Your hands
Tied up
Like two ships

Drifting
Weightless
Waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?

My heart
Your heart
Sit tight like book ends

Pages
Between us
Written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care
I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

Think of
How much
Love that's been wasted

People
Always
Trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care
I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh, oh
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care
I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong?

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care
I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care
I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong?
Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?

###"Olivia"###

Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing you
The consequences of falling out
Are something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with you

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, that's all I do
I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

###"She's Not Afraid"###

Yeah (aha), one, two, three, four!

[Harry:]
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go
Let it go
[Louis:]
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Take her home

[Liam:]
But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

[Zayn:]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love,
Love

[Niall:]
Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth
What you're worth
[Louis:]
Or maybe all her friends have told her don't get closer
He'll just break your heart
[Niall:]
But either way she's teasing me and it's just so hard
(So hard.)

[Liam:]
Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

(One, two, three, four)

[Zayn:]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love,
Love

[Harry:]
What about all the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me
Oooh

[Zayn:]
But when I say that I can't do it no more
She's back in my door

[Laugh]

[Zayn:]
She's not
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

She's not afraid
She's not afraid

[All:]
Ohhhhh

###"Heart Attack"###

Baby, you got me sick,
I don't know what I did,
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah,
Got your voice in my head,
Sayin' "Let's just be friends,"
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna be okay,
I'm tryna be alright,
But seein' you with him,
Just don't feel right.

And I'm like (ow!) never thought it'd hurt so bad
Gettin' over you-ooh,

It's (ow!) givin' me a heart attack,
Gettin' over you-ooh-ooh-ooh,

Yeah,
Baby now that you're gone,
I can't stand dumb love songs,
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah
Everyone's tellin' me,
I'm just too blind to see,
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah

I'm tryna be okay,
I'm tryna be alright,
But seein' you with him,
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (ow!) never thought it'd hurt so bad
Gettin' over you-ooh,
And (ow!) you're givin' me a heart attack
Lookin' like you do-ooh,
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,

Gettin' over you-ooh-ooh-ooh,

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Yeah, every time you look like that,
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're givin' me a heart attack

But seeing you with him,
Just don't feel right

And I'm like (ow!) never thought it'd hurt so bad
Gettin' over you-ooh,
And (ow!) you're givin' me a heart attack
Lookin' like you do-ooh,
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one
It's (ow!) givin' me a heart attack,
Gettin' over you-ooh-ooh-ooh,

You,

Ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Come on, you're all I ever wanted
Ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're giving me a heart attack,
Ow!

###"Summer Love"###

[Zayn:]
Yeah... oh...
Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

[Harry:]
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

[Niall:]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

[Louis:]
Wish that we could be alone now
We could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

[Liam:]
Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

[Niall:]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

[Zayn:]
So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I want to change, to change

[All:]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember
You were my summer love (summer love)
You always will be my summer love (summer love)
You always will be my summer love (yeah)
You always will be my summer love

###"Clouds"###

I know you said that you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple no

Someday you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end

We're never coming back down
We're looking down on the clouds

I know you said that you don't like it complicated
That you were tired of all the changes
But love is always always changing woah

Someday you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you'd never left me

Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end
Here we go again
Another go round for all of my friends
Another non stop will it ever end

We're never coming back down

###"Infinity"###

Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow

Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're OK
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're OK
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity, infinity, infinity

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're OK
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

###"Taken"###

[Liam]
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along

[Harry]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only loved to see me breaking
You only want me cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken

[Liam and Harry]
You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake

[Harry]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only loved to see me breaking
You only want me cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken

[Zayn]
Thank you for showing me
Who you are underneath
No, thank you, I don't need
Another heartless misery
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you anymore

[Harry]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only loved to see me breaking
You only want me cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can (no you don't, no you don't)
Still be the one who gets it breaking (breaking)
You only want me when I'm taken

[Liam]
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me

###"Something Great"###

One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day you'll say these words
I've thought but never said
You say we're better off together in our bed

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?

You're all I want
So much it's hurting
You're all I want
So much it's hurting

###"Everything About You"###

[Liam Payne:]
You know I've always got your back, girl
So let me be the one you come running to, running to, r-r-running
I see it's just a matter of fact, girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep coming

[Harry Styles:]
On the other side of the world, it don't matter
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it every time
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

[All:]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you

[Niall Horan:]
Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it but don't realize that it's m-my loving
There's something about your laugh that it makes me wanna have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at n-n-nothing

[Louis Tomlinson:]
Every minute's like the last so let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-ticking

[Harry Styles:]
I still feel it every time
It's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to

[All:]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to
It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you

[Zayn Malik:]
And you have always been the only one I wanted
And I wanted you to know without you I can't face it

[Zayn Malik and Harry Styles:]
All we wanna have is fun
But they say that we're too young
Let them say what they want

[Harry Styles and Liam Payne:]
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
Everything about you, you, you (everything about you)
It's everything that you do, do, do (everything about you)
It's everything about you

###"Stole My Heart"###

[Harry:]
Waiting for a girl like you

[Liam:]
The light shines, it's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends, they look good but you look better
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, 'round, 'round

[Harry:]
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart, with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

[Liam:]
I'm weaker, my worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on 'head, don't you fail me now (don't you fail me now)

###"A.M."###

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M. (yeah yeah)

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 goin' on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M.
Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it (yeah, yeah)

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learned, how

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations

###"History"###

[Harry:]
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Niall:]
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Liam:]
All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Louis:]
Mini bars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos
And the good champagne, and private planes, but they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize that without you here life is just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

So don't let me go

[All:]
We can live forever

[Liam:]
Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know

[All:]
We can live forever

###"They Don't Know About Us"###

People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say they don't know what they're talk-talk-talkin' about (talk-talk-talkin' about)

'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

Oh

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love you's"
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all night
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love yous"
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all night
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know about us

They don't know what we do best
It's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love yous" (I love you)
But I bet you if they only knew (if they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us (they would just be jealous of us)
They don't know about the up all night
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (feels so right)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the "I love yous"
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all night
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

They don't know about us
They don't know about us

###"Nobody Compares"###

[Niall:]
You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

[Zayn:]
You're so London your own style, your own style
And together we're so good, so girl why are you
Tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

[Harry:]
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before

[All:]
Cause no one ever looked so good in a dress
And it hurts cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

[Louis:]
We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart

[Harry:]
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did let's work through it
There's gotta be some way

But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

###"18"###

[Harry:]
I got a heart
And I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Zayn:]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Harry:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]
We took a chonce [An alternative for the word 'chance'. Commonly used by One Direction's Niall Horan]
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

[Liam:]
So pour me a drink, oh, love,
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can livin' love in slow motion, motion, motion

[Zayn:]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[All:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

[Niall:]
When we were 18
Oh, Lord, when we were 18

[Zayn:]
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Louis:]
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing

[Harry:]
To be loved and to be in love

[All:]
And all I could do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18

###"Rock Me"###

[Harry:]
Do you remember summer '09
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie it was the best time of my life
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh my, my, they can never shut us down

[Louis:]
I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered I will always believe

[Niall:]
I want you to
Rock me, rock me, rock me... yeah!
I want you to
Rock me, rock me, rock me... yeah!
I want you to
Hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care

Wanna roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye

[Louis:]

###"What Makes You Beautiful"###

[Liam:]
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Harry:]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[All:]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'd understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh, oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Zayn:]
So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right
I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes

[Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[All:]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh

[Harry:]
That's what makes you beautiful

Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana

[Harry:]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell

[All:]
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
([Harry:] desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh

[Harry:]
That's what makes you beautiful

###"Same Mistakes"###

[Harry]
Circles, we’re going in circles
Dizzy’s all it makes us
We know where it takes us
We've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blaming each other

[Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

[Liam]
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah

[Zayn]
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes

[Liam]
Don't look back
But if we don't look back
We’re only learning then
How to make all same mis-, same mistakes again

So we play, play, play all the same old games (same mistakes)
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change (when nothing's gonna change)
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same (well nothing's gonna be the same)
But we're making all the same mistakes

Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is (crazy is)
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix (there's nothing to fix)
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay (everything will be okay)
While you're making all the same mistakes

###"If I Could Fly"###

[Harry:]
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to

[Liam:]
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless

[Harry:]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

[Louis:]
I've got scars, even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing

[Niall:]
Pay attention, I hope that you listen cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless

[Harry, Liam, Louis, Niall:]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

[Louis and Harry (All):]
I can feel your heart inside of mine
(I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind
(I feel it, I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time
And I

[Harry:]
Hope that you don't run from me

[Louis:]
For your eyes only,

[Niall:]
I show you my heart

[Harry:]
For when you're lonely

[Liam:]
And forget who you are

[Harry:]
I'm missing half of me

[Harry, Liam, Louis, Niall:]
When we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only

[Niall, Harry, Louis, Liam:]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
[Harry:]
For your eyes only

###"Alive"###

My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet.
I can't control it.
Yeah, I know it's taking over me.
I'm going crazy.
Can't contain it.
So tell me just what I should do?"

She said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
She said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."

Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her right up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said, "OK," but she was worried what her friends will think
She's going crazy
Can't contain it
She asked me, "What should I do, oh?"

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
I said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."

We got to live before we get older
Do what we like
We got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
Oh, we got nothing to prove

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."

I said, "Hey, it's alright.
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back,
Live your life,
Even if it's only for tonight."
I said, "Hey, it's alright
If it makes you feel alive."

###"Fireproof"###

I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
Something deep inside me, I can't give up,
I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck, yeah,
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck,

I'm feeling something deep inside,
Hotter than a jet stream burning up,
I got a feeling deep inside,
It's taking, it's taking all I got, yeah,
It's taking, it's taking all I got.

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe we're fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.

I think I'm gonna win this time,
Riding on the wind and I won't give up,
I think I'm gonna win this time,
I roll and I roll, 'til I change my luck, yeah,
I roll and I roll, 'til I change my luck,

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long, we must be fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do,

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do,
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do,
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe we're fireproof,
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do.

###"Up All Night"###

[Liam:]
It feels like we've been livin' in fast forward
Another moment passing by
(Up up up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight
(Up up up all night)

[Harry:]
Katy Perry's on replay
She's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way
Yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake

[All:]
I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you

Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night
Like this, all night, hey
Up all night

[Zayn:]
Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
(Up up up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back
(Up up up all night)

Up all night

###"Long Way Down"###

We made a fire
Went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean
And drowned in a wave
Built a cathedral
But we never prayed
We had it all, yeah
And we walked away

Point of no return
And now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you,
But I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down
It's a long way down from here

We had a mountain
But took it for granted
We had a spaceship,
But we couldn't land it
We found an island,
But we got stranded
We had it all, yeah
Who could've planned it?

Point of no return
And now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you,
But I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm fallin'
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
