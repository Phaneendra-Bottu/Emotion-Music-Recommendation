###"Stay"###

All along it was a fever
A cold-sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something."
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer."

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move

Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way

I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ooh

###"Fading"###

You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Ta-ta, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

###"There's A Thug In My Life"###

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lot of game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)

And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight

You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right

He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)

###"Farewell"###

Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

I will write to tell you what's going on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell

Try to hold back my tears

'Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave

Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here

###"Kisses Don't Lie"###

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lusting, yeah

So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missing
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Whoa)

You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missing
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (Listen, hey, oh)
And it's tearing me all up inside (Inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me (Crush me, baby)
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in? (Trust in, hey, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Don't lie, baby, kisses don't lie)

###"Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary"###

[Part I: Love Without Tragedy]

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

[Part II: Mother Mary]

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name

For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

###"The Last Song"###

Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song, but baby we'll hear it when I'm gone

It's time to turn on the last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again holding hands with my friend again
But then again maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget
Baby let them play it maybe it'll save the world
They gonna miss hearing it when it's gone

But it's time to turn on the last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh

What if we left every moment that we could spare
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful that's why I started singing it
But this song is our song
So it's playing until the end even if it's the last song

The last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
Ooh

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-oh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Sweet loving is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss them days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever

###"Rehab"###

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (Using like I bleed)

It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab (Oh)
'Cause baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab (Oh)
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

###"We Found Love"###

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

###"Final Goodbye"###

I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Mm

Hold on me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside, the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

Promise you our love
Will carry on
Until you turn eternal
We belong

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye

Goodbye

###"Lost In Paradise"###

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

###"Numb"###

Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

###"Wait Your Turn"###

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

###"Cold Case Love"###

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold-case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold-case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love
We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love
Love

###"Complicated"###

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

###"Drunk On Love"###

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No

I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can't get enough

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I'll stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up

You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

It's all that I need
It's all that I need

###"Russian Roulette"###

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps."
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Ooh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

###"Question Existing"###

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Ha ha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

###"Photographs"###

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs

###"Stupid In Love"###

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love

Got up in the club, posted in the back

Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain

Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

To be what you is you gotta be what you are

###"The Last Time"###

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh

###"Fire Bomb"###

Gunfire left a hole in the tank
Losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail
And he's after me

Hope it don't get here
Before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breathe

You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going I don't need my brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So, I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold but, baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going we don't need no brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb

It can creep up inside you and consume you (Aha!)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Aha!)
It's too close for comfort, ah

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

###"Unfaithful"###

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

###"Fool In Love"###

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
'Til I've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
'Til I've had enough

So hard, so hard (Yeah! Yeah!)
So hard, so hard (Yeah! Yeah!)

All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million (Young!)
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to em

Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?

###"We Ride"###

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin' (And my lovin')
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why you said

We ride (Mmm)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride (Yeah)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

We ride

###"A Million Miles Away"###

Here we lay, face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto could have been's, that we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

Was it me? Or was it you that broke away?
From what we were
'Cause like the seasons, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ooh-yeah
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Hey, yeah
A million miles away

###"Now I Know"###

Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It's the way it's gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Yeah, no no
Now I know

###"Sell Me Candy"###

Sell me candy like it's summer when it's melting in my hands
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I'm weak by your touch and when it's melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you're knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shorty that you're rocking is nothing like me
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

I wanna play, more than you know
So don't you leave, and don't you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

###"Te Amo"###

Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Listen we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I'm moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Think it means I love you
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?

###"California King Bed"###

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed 
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here looking like you do
You're making staying over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dance floor, acting naughty

###"Skin"###

The mood is set (Huh, huh)
So you already know what's next (Uh-huh, ah)
TV on blast, turn it down, turn it down
Don't want it to clash
With my body screaming out, no (No-oh)
I know you hearing it (Oh-oh)
You got me moaning now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret, so I'ma drop em to the floor, oh

And no teasing, you waited long enough
Go deep, I'ma throw it at you, can you catch it?
Don't hold back, you know I like it rough
Know I'm feeling you, huh
Know you're liking it, huh
So why you standing over there with your clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'ma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me

###"No Love Allowed"###

911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fi-fo-fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor

Mama said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more

###"Man Down"###

Sak pasé!

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when

When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ay-uh

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

###"What Now"###

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Oh, oh, oh, oh! What now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know oh oh why

Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me

I'm walking over to you, meet me by the door
I'm the girl in the seven inch heels
I got my keys in my hand
Maybe S's on my arms, so guess you know what it is
So act like you know
'Cause a girl just wanna have fun
Knock it out the park for me
Need ya to hit a home run, boy

Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you gon' want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

Let too much to talk about it
Not into me, boy, I doubt it
You are gonna scream and shout it
Make you hot how I move my body
So crazy, so amazing
Catch you up and make you chase it
Let me, let me, baby
Let me do those things for you

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you gon' want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
