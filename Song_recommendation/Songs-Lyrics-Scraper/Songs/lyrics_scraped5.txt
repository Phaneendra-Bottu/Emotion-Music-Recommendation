###"Break Free"###

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby, ooh

Thought of your body
I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time

Oh, baby

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

###"Only 1"###

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you when there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinkin'
Is this too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
Baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm layin' down
With you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't sayin' that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
So baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
All the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

Only 1
Be your only 1
Only 1

###"Baby I"###

###"My Everything"###

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it

To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying "Sorry" for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are
You are
You are my everything
You are
You are
You are my everything

I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you and I know "Sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are...

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

You are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are my everything

###"Love Me Harder"###

[Ariana Grande:]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Baby, love me harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[The Weeknd:]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time

[Ariana Grande {The Weeknd}:]
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder {I'mma love you harder}
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Love me, baby, love me) {love me harder}
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder (You gotta love me harder)

[The Weeknd {Ariana Grande}:]
So what do I do if I can't figure it out (figure it out)?
You got to try, try, try again, yeah
So what do I do if I can't figure it out (figure it out)?
{I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again}

[Ariana Grande {The Weeknd}:]

And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Got to love me, baby)
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Love me harder, love me harder)

###"Daydreamin'"###

Oh, I think when I was standing on that stoop and I looked at him, yeah, I was 11 years old

###"Piano"###

Oh-whoa
Oh-whoa

Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow

Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)

###"Best Mistake"###

[Ariana Grande:]
How soon do we forget
How we felt
Dealing with emotions
That never left
Playing with the hand that
We were dealt
In this game

Maybe I'm the sinner
And you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending
What we ain't
Why we pointing fingers
Anyway
When we're the same

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you,
For you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

[Big Sean:]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pick-pockets
I guess to go the distance
We might need to pit stop it
Hold up
I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out
Started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much
'Cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones of ones
And we the oddest couple only human
Except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Ariana Grande:]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah
You're, you're, you're, you're, mm
I'll be saving my love for you, for you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
You're, you're, you're, you're, mm
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
I'll be saving my love for you, for you

###"Better Left Unsaid"###

I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need you, I'll be alright."
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
I'm gonna say things like, "Shut up and kiss me!"
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

Too many drinks, so many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

You don't need a lot of money
Honey you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your loving
To get the blood rushing through my veins

###"You'll Never Know"###

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't, no, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown) (Oh-oh)
Your way back then

Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown, babe)
Your way back then (Way back then, baby)
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)

###"One Last Time"###

I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should've been more careful

Love me and don't look back
I want you with me on this road to the sky
We'll be shining every night I promise you
Just me and you
Oh I promise you

###"You Don't Know Me"###

Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

My love

###"Just A Little Bit Of Your Heart"###

I don't ever ask you
Where you've been
And I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with

I can't even think straight
But I can tell
That you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I don't ever tell you
How I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to
Say what I mean

And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love
Is better than none

(Oh, babe)

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

(Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da)
(Da, da) Uh-huh
(Da, da) Ooh, yeah
(Da, da) Mm, ah
(Da, da) (It's the Rascals)

[Ariana Grande:]
I looked in my rear-view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic

Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in—
Traffic, I'm under
Pressure, pressure—
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Avenue
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back
