So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart On the radio beat They're playing 'Chasing Cars' And I thought of us Back to the time You were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand Back through lamp-lit streets and knew Everything led back to you  So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? Hear the song my heart is beating to?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh I know And oh I know oh And I know oh oh oh  I can see the stars from America

Eminem,The City,This city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake My hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind Don't control what I'm into  London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two  The pavement is my friend Hey and it will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I'm used to The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow  London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two  And my lungs hurt And my ears bled With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts But I need to move along  I'm from a city where the rain won't sleep Pollution in the air matches that on the street The black smoke Gets your head into a muddle like Walking into elephants Syringes in a puddle like I was a country boy when I moved out Grew up too fast for my family to find out Now I try to stop my music running into nose dives Can't resort to arrogance With white lies This city wants to raise me But I can't help but see just How this dark city changed me It's all the same see Music is my life but Now I try to fight Whatever I need to hide from North South East West London's my home now Knees weak but we never slow down Now I start to do my music properly I'll stay away from all the negative shit That will follow me  London calls me a stranger This is not my home home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two

And I found truth In people I barely know But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh oh oh  I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said  Romeo save me. I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  Marry me Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Taylor Swift,Long Live,I said remember this moment In the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild  We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew Our lives would never be the same  You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  I said remember this feeling I pass the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now  We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town  And the cynics were outraged Screaming This is absurd! 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall  Will you take a moment Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if God forbid fate should step in  And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell them my name  Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine  Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you  Long long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Singing long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered
Taylor Swift,Mine,You were in college working part-time waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  I say Can you believe it? As we're lying on the couch The moment I could see it Yes yes I can see it now  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes yes this is what I thought about  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  And I remember that fight Two-thirty AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the Goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said I'll never leave you alone.  You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine.  Hold on make it last Hold on never turn back  (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine  (Hold on) Yeah yeah Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now (Hold on) And I can see it (Yes yes) I can see it now (see it now see it now)
Taylor Swift,Begin Again,Took a deep breath in the mirror He didn't like it when I wore high heels But I do Turn the lock and put my headphones on He always said he didn't get this song But I do I do  Walked in expecting you'd be late But you got here early and you stand and wave I walk to you You pull my chair out and help me in And you don't know how nice that is But I do  And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  You said you never met one girl Who had as many James Taylor records as you But I do We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy But I do  But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did  I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up But you start to talk about the movies that your family Watches Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that And for the first time what's past is past  'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months  Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again  But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

Coldplay,Violet Hill,It was a long and dark December From the rooftops I remember There was snow white snow  Clearly I remember From the windows they were watching While we froze down below  When the future's architectured By a carnival of idiots on show You'd better lie low  If you love me won't you let me know?  Was a long and dark December When the banks became cathedrals And a fox became God  Priests clutched onto Bibles Hollowed out to fit their rifles And a cross was held aloft  Bury me in armour When I'm dead and hit the ground My nerves are poles that unfroze  And if you love me won't you let me know?  I don't want to be a soldier Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow far below  So if you love me why d'you let me go?

Maroon 5,Nothing Lasts Forever,It is so easy to see Dysfunction between you and me We must free up these tired souls Before the sadness kills us both I tried and tried to let you know I love you but I'm letting go It may not last but I don't know Just don't know  If you don't know then you can't care And I show up but you're not there But I'm waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you  Every day With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way  A bed that's warm with memories Can heal us temporarily But misbehaving only makes The ditch between us so damn deep Built a wall around my heart Never let it fall apart Strangely I wish secretly It would fall down while I'm asleep  If you don't know then you can't care And I show up but you're not there But I'm waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you baby  Every day With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way  But we have not hit the ground Doesn't mean we're not still falling oh I want so bad to pick you up But you're still too reluctant to accept my help What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame But until then the fact remains  Every day With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay Nothing lasts forever But be honest babe (Yeah) It hurts but it may be the only way Every day With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way

Maroon 5,Infatuation,Baby I don't wanna spend my life on trial For something that I did not do And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time I wouldn't pass right by you Maybe it's because you are so insecure Maybe you plain don't care Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off I fall so when it's just not there  Burn another bridge break another heart Try again it will only fall apart  Infatuation Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me It's such a shame that you shot me down It would have been nice to be around I'm touching your skin If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?

Maroon 5,Back At Your Door,From the moment the lights went off Everything had changed Lie awake in an empty room In my head it all feels the same  Like the taste of the day you left That still lingers on my breath And the dampness of tears that left A stain where you had wept  All alone with the negligee That still hangs off of my bed I keep meaning to give it away But I just leave it there instead  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Three more days 'til I see your face I'm afraid it's far too much Cook a meal and fix up the place Dial your number hang it up  If I took you for granted I apologize for acting tough You're my reason for living And there's no way I'm giving up oh  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Now every evening is a bitter fight And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night I know what your friends say He's just wasting your love and time I will never let you change your mind  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  No need to cry about it I may just die without it Every time I wind up back at your door  Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Every time I wind up back at your door Every time I wind up back at your door

Maroon 5,Harder To Breathe,How dare you say that my behaviour's unacceptable So condescending unnecessarily critical I have the tendency of getting very physical So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle  You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here The double vision I was seeing is finally clear You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up. (Yeah yeah yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?  What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head You should know better you never listened to a word I said Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up. (Yeah yeah yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams She said Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?  And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn That it's me that has all the control?  Does it thrill? Does it sting When you feel what I bring And you wish that you had me to hold?  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up. (Yeah yeah yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe? Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy? Woe is me If we're not careful turns into reality  But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending Where we're dancing in our tears  And God tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run Searching for meaning But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  And I thought I saw you out there crying And I thought I heard you call my name And I thought I heard you out there crying Just the same  And God give us the reason youth is wasted on the young It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run Searching for meaning But are we all lost stars trying to light ... light up the dark?  And I thought I saw you out there crying And I thought I heard you call my name And I thought I heard you out there crying But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark? Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
Maroon 5,The Sun,After school walking home Fresh dirt under my fingernails And I can smell hot asphalt Cars screech to a halt to let me pass  And I cannot remember What life was like through photographs And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.  Moving on down my street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.  The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me  Hate to love and love to hate her Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone And on and on and on and on  I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several milesâ€”. She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.

Michael Jackson,Scared Of The Moon,Alone she lays waiting Surrounded by gloom Invaded by shadows Painting the room The light from the window Cuts through the air And pins the child lying there Scared of the moon  She pulls up the covers And shivers in fright She hides from the color That rides on the night The light through the window That lights up the sky And causes her mournful cry Scared of the moon  There's nothing wrong Don't be bothered they said It's just childish fantasies turning your head No need to worry It's really too soon But there she lies shivering Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon  The years go by swiftly And soon childhood ends But life is still fearful When evening descends The fear of a child Still intrudes the night Returning on beams of light Scared of the moon  The feeling of terror She felt as a youth Has turned from a fantasy Into the truth The moon is the enemy Twisting her soul And taking its fearful toll Scared of the moon  But now there are others who sit in a room And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom Together they gather Their lunacy shade But knowing just why they're scared Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon

Michael Jackson,Little Susie,Somebody killed little Susie The girl with the tune Who sings in the daytime at noon She was there screaming Beating her voice in her doom But nobody came to her soon...  A fall down the stairs Her dress torn Oh the blood in her hair... A mystery so sullen in air She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  Everyone came to see The girl that now is dead So blind stare the eyes in her head... And suddenly a voice from the crowd said This girl lived in vain Her face bear such agony such strain...  But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried As he reached down To close Susie's eyes... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  It was all for God's sake For her singing the tune For someone to feel her despair To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed Then to scream out And nobody's there...  She knew no one cared...  Father left home poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather's soul too had flown... No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear Rejecting the needs in her prayers...  Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care So young and so fair
