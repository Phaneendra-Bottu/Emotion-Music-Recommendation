Ed Sheeran,Legacy,Tell me where to go tell me what to do I'll be right there for you Tell me what to say no matter if it's true I'll say it all for you  I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian? What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in? 'Cause I don't belong in this world That's why I'm scoffing at authority defiant often Flying off at the handle at my mom no dad So I am non-compliant at home at school I'm just shy and awkward And I don't need no goddamn psychologist Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems Thinking he can try and solve them I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk And in the front drive talking to myself Either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'Cause he said that I eyeballed him  And if you fall I'll get you there I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought Inside your world Please have faith in my words  'Cause this is my legacy legacy eh This is my legacy legacy eh There's no guarantee It's not up to me We can only see This is my legacy legacy Legacy legacy  I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling Why am I so differently wired in my noggin? 'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come it's mind boggling 'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit Bothers me but not my father he said Sayonara then split But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I Find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit But if this is all there is for me life offers Why bother even try and put up a fight it's nonsense But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience What about them rhymes I've been jottin' They're kinda giving me confidence Instead of tryna escape through my comics Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that I could be iconic in my conquest That's word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest  This is my legacy legacy eh This is my legacy legacy eh There's no guarantee It's not up to me We can only see This is my legacy legacy Legacy legacy  I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome 'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work Words like this and connect lines like crosswords And use my enemy's words as strength To try and draw from and get inspired off em 'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit Now you shut up bitch I am talking Thought I was full of horseshit and now You fucking worship the ground on which I am walking Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins 'Cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of Brian Baldingers You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can Suck a dick the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage The most high exalting and I ain't halting 'Til I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes The best part about me is I am not you I'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my  Legacy legacy eh This is my legacy legacy eh There's no guarantee it's not up to me we can only see This is my legacy legacy Legacy legacy,fear
Ed Sheeran,Still Don't Give A Fuck,A lot of people ask me am I afraid of death? Hell yeah I'm afraid of death I don't want to die yet A lot of people think that I worship the Devil That I do all types of retarded shit Look I can't change the way I think And I can't change the way I am But if I offended you good 'Cause I still don't give a fuck  I'm zonin' off of one joint stoppin' the limo Hopped in the window shoppin' a demo at gunpoint A lyricist without a clue what year is this? Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this Livin' amuck never givin' a fuck Give me the keys I'm drunk and I've never driven a truck But I smoke dope in the cab I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah) A killer instinct runs in the blood Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud I've calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz My brain's gone my soul's worn my spirit is torn The rest of my body's still bein' operated on I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme 'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time  For all the weed that I've smoked yo this blunt's for you To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too To all the friends I used to have I miss my past But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass For all the drugs that I've done yo I'm still gon' do To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too For every time I reminisce yo I miss my past But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass  I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue I'll hang you 'til you dangle and chain you with both ankles And pull you apart from both angles I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins And bust open like broken water mains So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb 'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on And the pants to match (Here Momma try 'em on) I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again  For all the weed that I've smoked yo this blunt's for you To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too For all the friends I used to have I miss my past But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass For all the drugs that I've done yo I'm still gon' do To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too For every time I reminisce yo I miss my past But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass  I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit) Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt? I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches I don't rap to get the women fuck bitches Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes Never ran with a clique I'm a posse Kamikaze strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me From the second I was born my momma lost me I'm a cross between Manson Esham and Ozzy I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage? Fuck I was born durin' an earthquake  For all the weed that I've smoked yo this blunt's for you To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too To all the friends I used to have yo I miss my past But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass For all the drugs that I've done yo I'm still gon' do To all the people I've offended yeah fuck you too For every time I reminisce I miss my past But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass,fear
Ed Sheeran,Asshole,Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole that role think I succeeded fulfillin' But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children Everything was happenin' so fast. It was like I blinked sold 3 million Then it all went blank all I remember is feelin' ridiculous 'cause I was getting sick of this feelin' Like I'm always under attack man I coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin' Women dishin' but really Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit. But since when did this many People ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end That's why every time you mention a lyric I thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it 'Cause it gave me an enormous platform I'm flattered you thought I was that important But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it Mad awards had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy They told me to slow down I'd just zone-out Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like telling Gwen Stefani she sold out 'Cause I was tryna leave no doubt In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now Because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you're just an asshole Everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows Everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice There's no place you can hide you are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows  Thanks for the support asshole Thanks for the support asshole  Quit actin' salty I was countin' on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history well goddamn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Nah I'm off him but what the fuck's all this trash-talking about? The fight was fixed I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down I went down for the count I fell but the fans caught me and now You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt Word to Pacquiao mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about Better go in that ring and knock 'em out or you better not come out It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare so what if insults are revoltin' Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled but you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest On your chest And a Glock just to go watch Batman Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man Half you don't got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those Water bottles in Colorado so get lost Waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole better pack toilet paper But I'm takin' no crap hoe here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreating 'Cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you're just an asshole Everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows Everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice There's no place you can hide you are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows  Holy mackerel. I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth. I smacked a girl Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull Then screamed ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work? 'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable Hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical I'm makin' up words so you can understandable It's tragical thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical You crackin' a joke? It's laughable 'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable My heart is truly guarded Full body armor bitch you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you're special you're retarded Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina You're a trainwreck I got a one-track mind and shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er 'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a minor Been tryna hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent 'Cause all of my spare time's spent On my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin' Only women that I love are my daughters but sometimes I rhyme And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent I'll never grow up so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time It ain't never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime So even if I'm half-dead I'm half-alive Poured my half-empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster I'm goin' back to what got me here yeah cocky and Can't knock bein' Rudolph so fear not my deer And dry up your tear drops I'm here White America's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird If you stare at me and see yourself 'cause you're one too shouldn't be a shock be 'Cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you're just an asshole Everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows Everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice There's no place you can hide you are just an asshole Everyone knows everyone knows,anger

I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster (Okay) Peace out (Bye-bye) Then I jetted to the weed house smoked out 'Til I started bustin' freestyles broke out Then I dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt) It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut can you accept? I want to make songs all the fellas dub And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of So just remember when I bomb your set Yo I only cuss to make your mom upset  Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight) Cum on everybody (Get down tonight),disgust

Kelly I start ballin' Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis But I'm not throwin' ones fives 10s or even 20s I'm throwin' quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's from the North East and West But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outtie Now hop in my minivan let's get rowdy Come on  Now you can do this on your own But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone So get on the floor and grab somebody Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party) So let's have us a little bash And if anyone asks it ain't no one but us trash You don't know you better ask somebody 'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)  Now whether you're black white or purple if you're misunderstood But you don't give a fuck you ain't doin' shit that you should Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good Get on the floor man and rep your hood  Now honey don't let them pricks trip we should make a quick dip And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot 'cause girl—I got a sick whip Kick the back window outta my Gremlin Put two milk crates in the trunk rip out the stick shift And make a five-seater I'll be damned if I feed a chick It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down 'Fore I turn over a new leaf clown I'll tell you now I'm so raw I still need to unthaw You feel me y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall But baby a body like that's against the law You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw Coleslaw containers empty straw wrappers and all You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car Now get up  Now you can do this on your own But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone So get on the floor and grab somebody Ain't nothin' but a white trash party So let's have us a little bash And if anyone asks it ain't no one but us trash You don't know you better ask somebody 'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party),anger
Ed Sheeran,Beautiful,[Sample - Rock Therapy Reaching Out:] Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me like I'm reaching out for you?  [Eminem:] I'm just so fuckin' depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet and I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles  In my shoes just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you yeah so...  I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything is so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room Just as soon as I walk in It's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact 'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fucking man servant Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of them ain't even funny like Ha! Marshall you're so funny man you should be a comedian God damn Unfortunately I am but I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles  In my shoes just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so  Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip them don't expect no help Now I could have either just Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in In every single place Every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid  Aunt Edna always told me Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that Meanwhile I'm just standin' there Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description 'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting It's probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear tens Let's see if you can fit your feet  In my shoes just to see What it's like to be me I'll be you let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you yeah so...  [Sample - Rock Therapy Reaching Out:] Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world where they can be alone... So are you calling me are you trying to get through oh? Are you reaching out for me like I'm reaching out for you? So oh oh  [Eminem:] Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon And to the rest of the world God gave you them shoes To fit you so put 'em on and wear 'em Be yourself man be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful So...,sadness

Ed Sheeran,Yellow Brick Road,What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you will to be Saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should Move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better  All right come on let's cut the bullshit enough Let's get it started let's start addressing this issue and open it up Let's take this shit back to the basement And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love The music we all enjoy The music you accuse me of tryna destroy Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit Crossing 8 Mile into Warren into hick territory I'd like to share a story this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me You have well informed me I am well aware that I don't belong here You've made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there From the black side all the way to the white side OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so well-known tracks  So let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard And drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps At Osbourne handing out some flyers he was doing some talent shows At Center Line High I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like White boys don't know how to rhyme. I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line  So let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  My first year in 9th grade can't forget that day at school It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors but man goddamn they flew Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes I had the new ones the Cool J Ice Lamb suede too But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news Guess who came through next X-Clan debut Professor X (Vanglorious!) Exist in a state of red black and green With a key sissies now with this being a new trend We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums Blackness is in African symbols and medallions Represents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all We was being laughed at You ain't even half black. You ain't 'posed to have that homie let me grab that And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement Saying how we hate this how racist but dope the X Clan's tape is Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time She was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull her Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the Ole Foolish Pride girl But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe  So let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Come on let's go back Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home  Fuck out of my house you fuckin' pieces of shit! Get the fuck out of my house you stupid fucker! You son of a bitch!,disgust
Ed Sheeran,When I'm Gone,Yeah... It's my life... In my own words I guess...  Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for? Not the expression no literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? Daddy look what I made Dad's gotta go catch a plane Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she? I don't know go play Hailie baby your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...  And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...  I keep having this dream I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming she don't want me to sing You're making Mommy cry why? Why is Mommy crying? Baby Daddy ain't leaving no more. Daddy you're lying. You always say that you always say this is the last time But you ain't leaving no more Daddy you're mine. She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it Daddy please Daddy don't leave Daddy no stop it! Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture This'll keep you safe Daddy take it with you. I look up it's just me standing in the mirror These fucking walls must be talking 'cause man I can hear 'em They're saying You've got one more chance to do right and it's tonight. Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late. And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage they're gone and this spotlight is on And I'm singing...  And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...  Sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat The curtain closes they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud I take one last look at the crowd I glance down I don't believe what I'm seeing Daddy it's me help Mommy her wrists are bleeding. But baby we're in Sweden how did you get to Sweden? I followed you Daddy you told me that you weren't leavin'. You lied to me Dad and now you made Mommy sad. And I bought you this coin it says 'Number One Dad'. That's all I wanted I just wanna give you this coin. I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going. But baby wait. It's too late Dad you made your choice. Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us. That's what they want they want you Marshall They keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep just take another pill Yeah I bet you you will. You rap about it yeah word k-keep it real I hear applause all this time I couldn't see How could it be that the curtain is closing on me? I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it Put it to my brain scream Die Shady! and pop it The sky darkens my life flashes The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes And burns to ashes That's when I wake up alarm clock's ringin' there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say  And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...

Ed Sheeran,Rhyme Or Reason,(What's your name?) Marshall (Who's your daddy?) I don't have one My mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon And had me on the back of a motorcycle Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap I'm loco It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum About to explode all over the canvas Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm (Your music usually has them) (But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't) (Follow you must Rick Rubin my little Padawan) A Jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts are entertaining But docile and impossible to explain and I'm also vain and Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting Puke Skywalker but sound like Chewbacca when I talk Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on (oh..) Oh it's on a rampage couldn't see what I wrote I write small (It says) Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls Had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch  But sometimes when I'm sleeping she comes to me in my dreams Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got I don't care don't have two shits to give Let me take you by the hand to promised land and threaten everyone 'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing  Nah (What's your name?) Marshall (Who's your daddy?) I don't know him but I wonder (Is he rich like me?) Ha ha (Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?) No  If he had he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad I wouldn't be so mad my attitude wouldn't be so bad yeah dad I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and Makes you want to get up and start dancing Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens to be rapping Blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank Lamping in my K-Mart mansion I'm in the style department With a pile in my cart ripping the aisle apart With great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content Completely despondent and condescending The king of nonsense and controversy is on a Beat-killing spree Your Honor I must plead Guilty 'cause I sparked a revolution Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap To take it to the next level boost it But several rebuked it and whoever produced it (Hip-hop is the devil's music) Does it mean it belongs to me? 'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep? But lyrically I never hear a peep not even a whisper Rappers better stay clear of me bitch 'Cause it's the…  It's the time of the season when hate runs high And this time I won't give it to you easy When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands And torture everyone that is my plan my job here isn't done 'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing  (What's your name?) Shady (Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck but I wonder (Is he rich like me?) Doubt it ha (Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)  So yeah dad let's walk Let's have us a father-and-son talk But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block Without me knocking your block off This is all your fault Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I appeal to all those walks of life Whoever had strife Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like 'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again It's hysterical I chuckle 'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles Yeah uh oh better beware knuckle heads The sign on my hustle says Don't knock The door's broken it won't lock It might just fly open get cold-cocked You critics come to pay me a visit Misery loves company please stay a minute Kryptonite to a hypocrite Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it Too busy getting stoned in your glass house To kick rocks then you wonder why I lash out Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out Completely brain-dead Rainman Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair So bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare Or get shanked in the pancreas I'm angrier than All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef 'Cause I hate every fucking thing yeah Even this rhyme bitch and quit tryna look For a fucking reason for it that ain't there I still am a criminal Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my genitals The last Mathers LP done went diamond This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald When will the madness end how can it when There's no method to the pad and pen The only message that I have to send Is Dad I'm back at it again. Bitch (who's your daddy?),anger

Ed Sheeran,Hello,Hello Allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady It's so nice to meet you It's been a long time I'm sorry I've been away so long My name is Shady I never meant to leave you  You see that chick in the gym checking me out? Any second I'm 'bout To stick her neck in my mouth I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?  There's the necklace I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse Man I should check to see if my mom left any out Nope guess I'll re-route Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch Oh! Jackpot! Yeah 'Open Sesame' mouth  Down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet A knapsack packed with like 40-some Xanaxes  Shorty come back I'm tryna score me some lapdances I'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules The bad apple spoils the bunch I'm back at you  Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waiting to say hello The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like Jello Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  My equilibrium's off must be the lithium I don't need to buy any drugs man people give me 'em It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum No reason in particular it was strictly fun  A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151 51 people asleep in my damn living room Excuse me hun? But what is your name? Vivian? I woke up next to you naked and uh did we umm?  Of course we did but didn't I strap Jimmy hun? I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  I find the package and I'm cool I immediately run Like Speedy Gonzalez to see if I see anyone Who might have a couple of threes I'm fiending for some My head is pounding to the beat of the drum  Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow? Some are oval and some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  Oh those were the days they certainly were It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good Word-word chi-word-word chi-word-chi-chi-word I second that and I third Rush to emergency surgery To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased  He's no longer getting them free Hundred bucks for these Percodans Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him  Tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers For his back and a couple of Paxils Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back Slipped and fell hit his back boom heard something go crack  Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap Almost ended it that soon because of the fact I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it I'm back  Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow Some are oval and some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  And so I'm saying  Hello allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady So nice to meet you It's been a long time I'm sorry I've been away so long My name is Shady I never meant to leave you  It's like starting over Clean slate,fear

Ed Sheeran,Stan,[Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  [Eminem as Stan:] Dear Slim I wrote you but you still ain't calling I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom I sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em There probably was a problem at the post office or something Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em But anyways; fuck it what's been up? Man how's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too I'm bout to be a father If I have a daughter guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him I know you probably hear this every day but I'm your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man I like the shit you did with Rawkus too that shit was phat Anyways I hope you get this man hit me back Just to chat truly yours your biggest fan This is Stan  [Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  [Eminem as Stan:] Dear Slim you still ain't called or wrote I hope you have a chance I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert You didn't have to but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew That's my little brother man he's only six years old We waited in the blistering cold for you For four hours and you just said No That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though I just don't like being lied to Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're saying in your songs So when I have a shitty day I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me See everything you say is real and I respect you 'cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you Slim no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up You gotta call me man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours Stan P.S. We should be together too  [Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  [Eminem as Stan:] Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sending you I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now I'm doing 90 on the freeway Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air Tonight About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning But didn't then Phil saw it all then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is you could've rescued me from drowning Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you Slim we could've been together think about it You ruined it now I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See Slim—shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk! Hey Slim that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up. See I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well gotta go I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit I forgot how am I supposed to send this shit out? [*car tires squeal crash loud splash*]  [Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  [Eminem:] Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she? Look I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother I wrote it on the Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit's just clowning  dawg C'mon! How fucked up is you? You got some issues Stan I think you need some counseling To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself I think that you'll be doing just fine If you relax a little I'm glad I inspire you but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it his name was... it was you Damn!,surprise
Ed Sheeran,Cleanin Out My Closet,Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones. There you go Yeah... yo yo  Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems victim of Münchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her she's beautiful But you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be!  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet,sadness

I don't rap for dead presidents I'd rather see the President [dead] It's never been said but I set precedents And the standards and they can't stand it My name shoulda been Bastard the shit shoulda been plastered On my forehead with a stamp I shoulda been blasted I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass But I'm too swift and fast for that I'm past it I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit! I done seen how fast this rap shit Can turn into some pap-pap shit that quick snap click But this time they got the fuckin' automatic Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack [*click*]  We as Americans us as a citizen Gotta protect ourselves look at how shit has been We better check ourselves livin' up in these streets Through worse and through better health survivin' by any means We as Americans us as a citizen We are Samaritans what do we get us in? We better check ourselves look at how shit has been Take a look where you live this is America and we are Americans  (Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us I tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis Under my long johns under my Sean Johns One run-in with the long arm of the law I'm long gone I'ma do five years — no less than that no questions asked So it might be a good idea that I stop right here And quit while I'm ahead already in the red Already got a steady infrared meant for my head A target on my back bigger problems than that Bin Laden on my ass he probably gon' send a task I ain't gon' even ask they ain't gon' let me pack They ain't gon' give me my semi but I got my weed back  We as Americans us as a citizen Gotta protect ourselves look at how shit has been We better check ourselves livin' up in these streets Through worse and through better health survivin' by any means We as Americans us as a citizen We are Samaritans what do we get us in?

I can almost taste it  Yeah can't stop now (I can almost taste it.) This may be the last chance I get to be famous (I just wanna be famous)  You dream of trading places I have been changing faces You cannot fill these shoes There is too much to lose Wake up behind these trenches You run around defenseless There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes I just wanna be famous But be careful what you wish for  I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist They call me Slim Roethlisberger I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker I murk her with a Mossberg I'm pissed off get murdered Like someone took a ketchup squirter Squirted a frankfurter For a gangster you sure did shit your pants When you saw the chainsaw get to waving Like a terrible towel How thangs turn around When his fangs come out Get your brains blown out That's what I call blowing your mind When I come back Like nut on your spine I'm the thumb tack That you slept on son Now here I come screaming Attack! Like I just stepped on one Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em Defiance giant scrotum He don't owe them bitches shit His britches he out growed 'em He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole And nobody fucks with him Rigor mortis and post mortem He's dying of boredom Take your best rhymes record 'em To try to thwart him He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em Shit-stained drawers You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws While he dips 'em in PF Chang's sauce Game's up homie hang it up like some crank calls You think I'm backing down? You must be out of your dang skulls I'm almost famous  You dream of trading places I have been changing faces You cannot fill these shoes There is too much to lose Wake up behind these trenches You run around defenseless There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes I just wanna be famous But be careful what you wish for  I'm back for revenge I lost a battle that ain't happening again I'm at your throat like strep I step strapped with a pen Metaphors wrote on my hand Some are just stored in my memory Some I wrote on a napkin I do what I have to to win Pullin' out all stops any who touch a mic prior's Not even Austin Powers how the fuck are they Mike Myers And tell that psycho to pass the torch To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern And smash it on his porch Now get off my dick Dick's too short of a word for my dick Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer I just blew up the Challenger matter fact I need a lawyer I just laced my gloves with enough plaster To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer Ya'll are Eminem backwards you're Meni Mes See he's in a whole 'nother weight class He slugs you're BBs you're bean-bag bullets You're full of it; you were dissin' his CDs Laughed at Infinite now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties No peace treaties he's turned into a beast His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E He's almost famous  You dream of trading places I have been changing faces You cannot fill these shoes There is too much to lose Wake up behind these trenches You run around defenseless There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes I just wanna be famous But be careful what you wish for  Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls Screaming the wood off the panelling And cussing the paint off the walls Spewing his hate to these haters showing no love for these broads He ain't given 'em shit he says he'll pinch a penny so hard He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark When it scars 'til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out Awww! His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them not at all If they don't like it they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die And eat shit while they at it He's fucking had it he's mad at the whole world So go to hell and build a snowman girl The bullies become bullied and pussies get pushed Then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me 'Cause I ain't looking back only forward this whole spot blowing Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it? And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered So bear witness to some biblical shit As a cold wind blowing This world ain't gonna know what hit it He did it he made it he's finally famous,fear

Ed Sheeran,When The Music Stops,[Bizarre:] Music reality Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference But we as entertainers Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!  [Eminem:] If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow Would you feel sorrow or show love? Or would it matter? Could never be the lead-off batter If there ain't shit for me to feed off I'm see-saw battlin' But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake There's too much on my plate I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away And not say what I got to say What the fuck you take me for a joke? You smoking crack? 'Fore I do that I'd beg Mariah to take me back I'll get up 'fore I get down Run myself in the ground 'fore I put some wack shit out I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark Y'all steady tryna drown a shark Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off Lid to the can of whip-ass just twist me off See me leap out pull a piece out Fuck shooting I'm just tryna knock his teeth out Fuck with me now bitch; let's see you freestyle! Talk is cheap motherfucker if you really feelin' froggish leap Yo Slim you gon' let him get away with that? He tried to play you you can't let him skate with that Man I hate this crap this ain't rap This is crazy the way we act when we confuse hip-hop With real life when the music stops  [Swifty McVay:] Ain't no getting rid of McVay if so you would've tried The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide I have died clinically Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy Got drunk then I finished him I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef I spark willingly with a Dillinger in the dark diligently I'm not what you think I appear to be fucked up Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor I just want my face in a paper I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight To awake neighbours for acres I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man Son of Sam; bitch I'm surgical I'm allergic to dying – you think not? You got balls? We can see how large when the music stops  [Kon Artis:] I was happy having a deal at first Thought money would make me happy But it only made my pain worse It hurts when you see your friends Turn their back on you dawg And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends Begging with their hands out Checking for your record when it's selling When it ain't that's the end: no laughs no friends No girls just the gin you drink 'til your car spin You think Damn! when you slam into the wall And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol If my funeral's tomorrow Wonder would they even call? When the music stops  [Kuniva:] Let's see how many of your men loyal When I pull up looking for you with a pistol Sipping a can of Pennzoil I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust Your head just explode with red stuff I'm handcuffed Tossed in the paddy-wagon Bragging about how you shouted like a coward Bullets devoured you showered you niggas If I was you niggas I'd run while given the chance Understand I can enhance the spirit of man Death itself it can't hurt me Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life Fuck a tour and a mic I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife Deliver that shit that coroners like You hype popping shit in broad daylight Nigga you're a goner at night; when the music stops  [Proof:] Instigators turn pits in cages Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors Y'all don't want war y'all want talk In the dark my dogs all bark like Woof! Proof nigga I'm a wolf Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hoofs Stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose The more y'all breathe shit the more I moves It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues Put a gun to rap check in all our dues Or make the news bet you all y'all move When the Uzi pop you better drop when the music stop  [Bizarre:] Music has changed my life in so many ways Brain's confused been fucked since the 5th grade LL told me to Rock the Bells NWA said Fuck the Police now I'm in jail Ninety-three was strictly R&B Fucked up haircut listened to Jodeci Michael Jackson – who gon' tell me I ain't Mike? Ass cheeks painted white fuckin' Priscilla tonight Flying down Sunset smoking crack Transvestite in the front Eddie Murphy in the back M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties Ludacris told me to throw them bows Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose And a fractured elbow Voices in my head I'm going in shock I'm reaching for the Glock but the music stops,sadness
Ed Sheeran,Drug Ballad,Yeah hahahaha...whooooo shit! Aight guess what? I ain't coming in yet... I'll come in a minute Ayo...This is my love song...it goes like this  Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot) This is how we used to make the party start We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark And when it kicks in you can hardly talk  And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall  And everything's spinning You're beginnin' to think women Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink Then in a couple of minutes That bottle of Guinness is finished You are now allowed to officially slap bitches  You have the right to remain violent and start wilin' Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you Get in your car start it and start drivin' Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up  Earth calling pilot to co-pilot Looking for life on this planet sir no sign of it All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin' And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it Let me out of this place I'm outta place I'm in outer space I've just vanished without a trace I'm going to a pretty place Now where the flowers grow I'll be back in an hour or so  'Cause every time I go to try to leave Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me  'Cause every time I try to tell them No They won't let me ever let them go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me  In third grade all I used to do Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube 17 years later I'm as rude as Jude Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs  I've got no game And every face looks the same They've got no name So I don't need game to play  I just say whatever I want to whoever I want Whenever I want wherever I want however I want  However I do show some respect to few This ecstasy's got me standing next to you Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you We just met but I think I'm in love with you  But you're on it too So you tell me you love me too Wake up in the morning like Yo what the fuck we do? I gotta go bitch You know I got stuff to do 'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you  But in the long run These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later But fuck it I'm on one So let's enjoy Let the X destroy your spinal cord So it's not a straight line no more 'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur Shit six hits won't even get me high no more So bye for now I'm going to try to find some more  'Cause every time I go to try to leave Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me  'Cause every time I try to tell them No They won't let me ever let them go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me  That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again It's your life Live it however you wanna Marijuana is everywhere Where was you brought up? It don't matter as long as you get where you're going ‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin' They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning  But you're young You've got a lot of drugs to do Girls to screw Parties to crash Sucks to be you If I could take it all back now I wouldn't I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated Did better drugs and updated But I've still got a lot of growing up to do I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew  But when it's all said and done I'll be 40 Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories With a bottle of Jack Two grandkids in my lap Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed  'Cause every time I go to try to leave Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me  'Cause every time I try to tell them No They won't let me ever let them go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me  'Cause every time I go to try to leave Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me  'Cause every time I try to tell them No They won't let me ever let them go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me  Drugs really got a hold of me Really got a hold of me 'Cause drugs really got a hold of me They really got a hold of me,fear

If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo Catch a homo by his toe man I don't know no more Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

My songs can make you cry take you by surprise And at the same time can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme See what you're seeing is a genius at work Which to me isn't work so it's easy to misinterpret it at first 'Cause when I speak it's tongue in cheek I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son And walk around the rest of my life spit on And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump N' Grind comes on More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane Aimed at the World Trade standin' on Ronnie's grave Screaming at the sky 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade And that's pretty much the gist of it Parents are pissed but the kids love it Nine millimeter heater stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers I don't blame you I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither  [Eminem:] There's really nothin' else to say I I can't explain it  [Hailie:] I think my dad gone crazy!

Ed Sheeran,Desperation,Girl you give me writer's block I'm at a loss for words uhh My mind's as lost as yours I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge Never seen no ass as large as yours How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas the first Date cause I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers in a vase A box of chocolates throat lozengers cough drops and Certs Probably should've never let me call that job of yours To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work Should've been one of the first signs to cause alert Man we jumped in too fast cause since then I just can't be apart from her Cause nobody's body's awesomer I lust it and she loves me Cause I'm popular but you know this ain't love  You know this ain't love you know this ain't love You know this ain't love you know this ain't love (What is it then?) It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right wants me to be that guy to her) It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight cause I give in at the sight of her) (And I here I go again)  You were obviously oblivious to me I swore I was just invisible to you Till I went to the lengths I did to meet you Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning Now I'm in disbelief I never knew that this could be such misery ah Cause now you see nothing but me and I don't see nothing but you And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in We stuck to each other's hips and we can't Do anything individually which is to cling on scared to be alone Can't specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason This definitive just need you talking bout I live and breathe you And you pretend to be as mentally and physically Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer Don't wanna be without you Don't wanna be with you neither bitch Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek Cause this ain't love  You know this ain't love you know this ain't love You know this ain't love you know this ain't love (What is it then?) It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right wants me to be that guy to her) It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight cause I give in at the sight of her) (And I here I go again)  Just want you to myself don't wanna share you with no one else What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves you make me sick I think our relationship it seems to be on the fritz I mean it's time that we just split and leave the Games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too Get the picture That's a negative Alicia I will never give the keys up To the crib ever again no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's You better have an epiphany slut guess what? The lease up I'm just mad the time it took to discover You were using me for loot like I used you for looks Oh thought you was too good for me huh? yeah Toots used to be my Carrie Underwood I was your lumberjack But I can't stomach this I'm leaving you I'm not coming back She said The fuck with that where's my Louisville Slugger at? She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head I barely ducked and that's right When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice steel toe Girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights  You know this ain't love you know this ain't love You know this ain't love you know this ain't love (What is it then?) It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right wants me to be that guy to her) It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight cause I give in at the sight of her) (And I here I go again),fear
Ed Sheeran,Bad Guy,It's like I'm in this dirt digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you it won't work All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off And left me so burnt spent a lot of time tryna soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well looks like I hit a growth spurt But I'm coming for closure Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh you thought it was over You could just close the chapter And go about your life like it was nothing You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine Well I've never recovered but tonight I bet you that what you're 'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges mind saying Let it go fuck this. Heart's saying I will once I bury this bitch alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.  I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But it's easier to justify What's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un; follow me I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un; follow me I ruh-uh-un)  And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch To think it was you at one time I worshiped shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it? Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew knit wit Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it! You left our family in shambles You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed? May be gone but he's not forgotten And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya You're wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him's same shit you did to me cold Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor all this pent-up resentment I hold on to Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing Letters you don't respond to 'em Fuck it I'm coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you Poof then I'm gone voosh And  I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But it's easier to justify What's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un; follow me I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me I ruh-uh-un; follow me I ruh-uh-un)  I've been driving around your side of this town Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now Finally I found your new address park in your drive Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house See it's sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But I ain't here for your empathy I don't need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential–I peeked Continue to peep still bent low Then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch Man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this You don't plan for intruders beforehand? Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue? Gag chloroform rag dag almost hack-up a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung Stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk By one of your fans irony's spectacular huh? Now who's a faggot you punk? And here's your Bronco hat you can have that shit back 'cause they suck It's just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it we're in a car right now Wait here comes my favorite lyric I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey here's a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell bitch I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits time is quite near Hope we don't get stopped no license I fear That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver's side mirror (Oh God police! Ah!) Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least New plan Stan Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car! Well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro it's for you Slim this is for him and Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good! Now say you hate homos again!  I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope it's hopeless I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again Back's to the wall I'm stacking up all them odds toilet's clogged Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished I am your lack of a conscience I'm the ringing in your ears I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal cords after your concerts I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow I'm the bullies you hate that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult batter But the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted 'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade and Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them I'm the hindsight to say I told you so! Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don't stop after they call you Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits When it's time to walk away I'm every guilt trip the baggage you have But as you gather up all your possessions If there's anything you have left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother So 'fore you rest your case Better make sure you're packing a wallop So one last time I'm back Before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the final chapter in a saga Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers' left off,anger
Ed Sheeran,Sing For The Moment,These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin' Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care he's A problem child and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!) 'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked he's mad so he's talkin' back Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants do-rags and a stockin' cap His step-father hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose his house is a broken home There's no control he just lets his emotions go  (Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!) sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Entertainment is changin' intertwinin' with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely 'cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh) I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass But then these critics crucify you (Yep) journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense B It's all political if my music is literal And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)  (Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!) sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!) Sing it with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves We entertainers of course the shit's affectin' our sales You ignoramus but music is reflection of self We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!) Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can…  Sing with me (Sing!) sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Sing with me (Sing!) sing for the year (Sing it!)

You're walkin' down a horror corridor It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a Nightmare it's horrible Right there's the coroner Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya You're a goner he's onto ya Out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience While everybody is watching in the party applauding it  Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again Contemplating my next plot again Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman At the Ramada Inn holdin' on to the pill bottle then Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it  Wake up naked at McDonald's with Blood all over me Dead bodies behind the counter shit Guess I must have just blacked out again Not again!  It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em) I said It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)  Sitting nude in my living room It's almost noon I wonder what's on the tube Maybe they'll show some boobs Surfin' every channel until I find Hannah Montana Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin Bust all over the wall paneling Dismantlin' every candle On top of the fireplace mantel and Grab my flannel and my bandanna then Kiss the naked mannequin man again You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in  I'm just a hooligan who's used to usin' hallucinogens Causin' illusions again Brain contusions again Cutting and bruisin' the skin Razors scissors and pins Jesus when does it end? Phases that I go through Dazed and I'm so confused Days that I don't know who Gave these molecules to Me. What am I gon' do? Hey the prodigal son The diabolical one Very methodical when I slaughter them  It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em) I said It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)  She puts the lotion in the bucket it puts the lotion on the skin Or else it gets the hose again She puts the lotion in the bucket it puts the lotion on the skin Or else it gets the hose again  I cut and I slash slice and gash Last night was a blast I can't quite remember when I had that Much fun off a half pint of the Jack My last Vic and a half A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass  I remember the first time I dismembered a family member December I think it was I was havin' drinks with my cousin I wrapped him in Christmas lights pushed him into the stinkin' tub Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood I thought I oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun. That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run A secret passageway around here man there's got to be one Oh no there's probably none He can scream all that he wants Top of his lungs but ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up... up 'Cause it's  3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em) I said It's 3 A.M. in the mornin' Put my key in the door and Bodies layin' all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)  Yo yo ayo (Evil rise) Yo yo ayo (Evil rise) Yo yo ayo (Evil rise) Yo yo ayo (Evil rise) (Evil rise) (Evil rise),fear
Ed Sheeran,Ricky Ticky Toc,Once you call my name out things will never be the same They should've never let us get our foot in this game  Ever since I was introduced to rap music I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice I could lose it At any moment those who know me know it So they probably told to go with the flow just so that I don't explode and- have another episode Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did I'm waiting for that next beef I'm cocked locked and loaded I'm ready to go so bad I'm going bananas my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!) Anybody I throw flames at gets a name It's a game 'cause they know that they don't spit the same It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame Every day it's the same thing people in this game Try to buddy-buddy us Just to get close enough to study us everybody just wants To have something to do with that They all trying to get that stamp they after that Shady/Aftermath money It's like a monopoly They probably just now finally understand How to Rob fully 50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me And Dre it's like we hit the fucking lottery And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers? When we rhyme with each other in time we discovered That we had more in common than we thought with each other Both robbed of our mothers our fathers ain't want us What was wrong with us was it our fault? 'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause Big L had just got popped just a month before If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia Two years later me and Doc had to come and uh- Operate that's when he popped up at number one And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering Even if I'm under the gun You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye There'll always be animosity between you and I But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call Nikes Earthlings how do you like these? You gotta love 'em look at the bottom of 'em they're like cleats Stomping I been romping Since Tim Dog was hollering Fuck Compton I was whiling freestyling Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet that tells us that Any doubts in your head that seals the shit Ricky ticky toc ticky ticky toc Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc Diggy Diggy Doc And ya' don't stop,anger

I don't even know his name I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah them chills used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em Throw 'em down pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in them It's the rage that took over It controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday Yesterday is over it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  Now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby please come back It wasn't you baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk Told you this is my fault Look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time?

Go for broke His cup just runneth over oh no He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game and they know Rap will never be the same as before Bashing in the brains of these hoes And establishing a name as he goes The passion and the flame is ignited You can't put it out once we light it This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot You dealing with a few true villains Who stand inside of a booth truth-spilling And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths Now rewind it! Payback motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste? When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place So Drake  It may not mean nothing to y'all But understand nothing was done for me So I don't plan on stopping at all I want this shit forever man ever man ever man I'm shutting shit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I ain't even planning to call I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man,neutral

Ed Sheeran,Music Box,Yeah girl Can you hear that? It's playing our song Are you sleepy? Take a nap You're not afraid of the dark are you?  You hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep I knock on Dakota's door. It's locked so I go to creep 'Round the back with binoculars: not 'cause I wanna peep But because I'm hungry. She smells like Tacos I wanna eat  Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet With sugar plums Oh look here comes Marshall! He's on your street! He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  Like a Thanksgiving turkey a holiday ham Cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam Flavor my favorite Graham crackers with JonBenét Rams' I guess a modern-day Jack The Ripper is all that I am  My music box 'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep But I can hear you my love. You keep calling me Although we're worlds apart you mean the world to me So when you call I come I will answer  'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep I hear my music box playing a song for me So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me? And would you be my private little dancer?  I almost look comatose Who wants to be sober gross? I foam like a Doberman. Mouth open I overdose Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose My pupils quadruple in size. Eyes are so bugged. I know  I put on my mother's make-up get naked and run around Wavin' the gun around I think I'm down to a hundred pounds There's thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out The devil's upset with his wife They must be sluggin' it out  I must be buggin' the fuck out But what the fuck about? Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house They pull and they tug my blouse The sound of a music box comes from inside a toy chest But what do I do? It's locked  I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts I dig 'til I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts It's playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark The moon is full. I smell a funeral. Guess I'll loom in the park  My music box 'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep But I can hear you my love. You keep calling me Although we're worlds apart you mean the world to me So when you call I come I will answer  'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep I hear my music box playing a song for me So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me? And would you be my private little dancer?  I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stix The sick Satan-worshippin' Bitches get horse-whippings I'm in the back Through the back door slipping through the crack Leavin' the corpse drippin'  The mortician of love sent from above Forced entry. The more wenchy the more stingy I become Been doin' this for more than a quarter century I'm just numb Am I dreamin'? Is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  The time has come to tie her up Gotta roll me the ladder I've had enough of the chatter Climb up to the window look at her Then climb in slow to shatter Her brain matter And batter Her with the bat A matter of fact that will splatter her But before I do that I'll have a chat to flatter her  Give her two compliments back-to-back like Tabitha I'm your secret admirer. I'm back to ravish you So strong is your fight but you're no match for Dracula.  Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack. So Pamela  My music box 'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep But I can hear you my love you keep calling me Although we're worlds apart you mean the world to me So when you call I come I will answer  'Cause when the lights are off I see the girl's asleep I hear my music box playing a song for me So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me? And would you be my private little dancer?,surprise

Ed Sheeran,Love Game,Something's burnin' I can't figure out what (Out what) it's either lust or a cloud of dust judgment is clouded must Just be the powder from the power of (Love) but I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get outta Left my girl in the house alone is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further I walk the louder Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard 'cause after all this is her place So I give her the benefit of the doubt I Think I might be about to busta bust her the thought's scary yo though and it hurts-brace Hope it ain't here we go yo 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario though in the first place But you confirmed my low end theory though should've known when I made it all the way to third base And that was only the first date could've made it to home plate But you slid straight for the dome and dove face First No [*slurp*] you don't [*slurp*] under—[*slurp*]—stand [*slurp*].

I'm just A fuckin' romantic I fuckin' love you you fuckin' bitch! Combative possessive in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events I said Hit the road and after she left I sent that bitch a text I said Be careful driving. Don't read this and have an accident!

Ed Sheeran,White America,America we love you How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold (Yo' I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told  I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me  So many lives I touched so much anger aimed In no particular direction just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays 'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days  Who would've thought standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair With some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?  I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government I'm lovin' it I shoveled shit all my life And now I'm dumping it on  White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get  Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby—ooh baby!—look at my sales  Let's do the math if I was black I would've sold half I Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at  When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up I was like Fuck it! until I met Dre the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass  Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got Like damn we just swapped sittin' back lookin' at shit wow I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now It's  White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get  See the problem is I speak to suburban kids Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss 'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence  Straight out the tube right into your living rooms I came And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them  That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin' with a fine tooth comb it's like this rope Waitin' to choke Tightening around my throat Watching me while I write this Like I don't like this Nope  All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early Surely hip-hop was never a problem In Harlem Only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom  So now I'm catchin' the flak From these activists when they raggin' Actin' like I'm the first rapper To smack a bitch or say faggot  Shit just look at me like I'm your closest pal The posterchild The motherfuckin' spokesman now for  White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get White America I could be one of your kids White America little Eric looks just like this White America Erica loves my shit I go to TRL look how many hugs I get  So to the parents of America I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica To attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy  Fuck you Ms. Cheney Fuck you Tipper Gore Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have Fuck you  I'm just playin' America you know I love you,anger
Ed Sheeran,Role Model,Okay I'm going to attempt to drown myself You can try this at home You can be just like me Mic check one-two we recordin'?  I'm cancerous so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus I'll strangle you to death then I'll choke you again And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin You beef with me I'ma even the score equally Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally I get too blunted off of funny home grown 'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch) My nerves hurt and lately I'm on edge Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you) Every girl I ever went out with has gone les' Follow me and do exactly what the song says Smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people And drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill Some people only see that I'm white ignorin' skill 'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill But I don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist I get a clean shave bathe go to a rave Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave My middle finger won't go down how do I wave? And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?  Now follow me and do exactly what you see Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? I slap women and eat shrooms then OD Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?  Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole When we heard a knock at the door must've been Ron Gold Jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold Killed them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco (We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer My rap style's warped I'm runnin' out the morgue With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits A premature birth that was four minutes late Mother are you there? I love you I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel) Will someone please explain to my brain That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain? I take a breather and sigh either I'm high or I'm nuts 'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room neither am I So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her 'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with I bought Cage's tape opened it and dubbed over it  I came to the club drunk with a fake ID Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? I've been with ten women who got HIV Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? I got genital warts and it burns when I pee Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree You probably wanna grow up to be just like me,anger
Ed Sheeran,Space Bound,We touch I feel a rush We clutch it isn't much But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us It's lust it's torturous You must be a sorceress 'cause you just Did the impossible Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous If you fuck me over 'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt 'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you And love is evol Spell it backwards I'll show you  Nobody knows me I'm cold Walk down this road all alone It's no one's fault but my own It's the path I've chosen to go Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's Bloodsucking succubuses what the fuck is up with this? I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be Like trying to start over I got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions so it's over It's like an explosion every time I hold you I wasn't joking when I told you You take my breath away You're a supernova... and I'm a  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Right at you  I'll do whatever it takes When I'm with you I get the shakes My body aches when I ain't With you I have zero strength There's no limit on how far I would go No boundaries no lengths Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same? You want them when they don't want you Soon as they do feelings change It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take Let's cut to the chase 'Fore a door shuts in your face Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open That I won't be making a mistake Cause I'm a...  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Right at you  So after a year and six months it's no longer me that you want But I love you so much it hurts Never mistreated you once I poured my heart out to you Let down my guard swear to God I'll blow my brains in your lap Lay here and die in your arms Drop to my knees and I'm pleading I'm trying to stop you from leaving You won't even listen so fuck it I'm trying to stop you from breathing I put both hands on your throat I sit on top of you squeezing 'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house And let you live Tears stream down both of my cheeks Then I let you go and just give And before I put that gun to my temple I told you this  And I would have did anything for you To show you how much I adored you But it's over now It's too late to save our love Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm so lost without you Without you Without you,fear

Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?,anger

Eminem,Save Myself,I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe I gave away my money and now we don't even speak I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me Oh honestly?  Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song It goes on and on  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same? And only scars remain  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger Just because they needed saving just like that Oh I'm here again between the devil and the danger But I guess it's just my nature My dad was wrong cause I'm not like my mum Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song but it helps So before I save someone else I've got to save myself  Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell So before I save someone else I've got to save myself And before I blame someone else I've got to save myself And before I love someone else I've got to love myself,sadness
Eminem,The Man,No I don't wanna hate you Just wish you'd never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school He's waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He's not the right guy for you Don't hate me cause I write the truth No I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But fuck it I won't be changing the subject I love it I'll make your little secret public it's nothing I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot I think not  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much And at the time we'd just go so sue me I guess I'm not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it's hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  And since you left I've given up my days off It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job But mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book I guess I lied in the hook Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career and music didn't exist In 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27 I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge Or did I make a mistake erasing? It's only therapy My thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit Take my apology I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore,fear
Eminem,All Of The Stars,It's just another night And I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star And thought of you I sang a lullaby By the waterside and knew If you were here I'd sing to you You're on the other side As the skyline splits in two Miles away from seeing you  But I can see the stars from America I wonder do you see them too?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart On the radio beat They're playing 'Chasing Cars' And I thought of us Back to the time You were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand Back through lamp-lit streets and knew Everything led back to you  So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? Hear the song my heart is beating to?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh I know And oh I know oh And I know oh oh oh  I can see the stars from America,fear
Eminem,Goodbye To You,Hey... Can you hear me? I just wanted to let you know... Hmm...  I hope you can hear what I write to you How could I say goodbye to you? When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you I gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man Cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free Just locked in a cage slaving They said they were gold in the pavements But you came and saw the road to amazement Broke your heart But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast I hope your listening right I still think of you every Sunday No one can top your chicken and rice Even through the darkness times You held us all up because your vision was bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside You never let anyone see your heartache You just got on with it Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful And your words you would stand strong with it Cause they were like warmth on a winter night But I was just too young to go on with it And there somethings I could try to do But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you I couldn't do that I owe my life to you.  And of the pieces of my soul... (Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one...  I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...  I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now I would be by your side when you needed me Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? ' Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now Everyone's missing you loads Jessica's grown up Warreen Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths I miss seeing a family being a family And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child But as time goes by the bridge seems longer Family problems have never been funny In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia She took all our inheritance money Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces I never forgive the way she betrayed us. There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing But I guess that everyone's different Or should I say no one's perfect? She had happiness in front of her But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing. Since you gone the foundations crumbled So building it back up is my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but It's hard when it's done I don't know what to expect So give me the strength that I need to perform this task Make it right I must do And I ask cause I trust you It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.  And of the pieces of my soul... (Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...) You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...  I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...  It's just for now so I should hush... I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you... Ohh how I miss you... It's just for now so I should hush... I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...  There ain't enough words to describe How sorry I am for the pain that I caused Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad And for the day police came to the door I'm sorry for being such a bad youth Stealing from your purse and making you mourn I never been able to say this before Cause I was so inconsiderate You loved me unconditionally And I took advantage of it like a idiot. Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I really hope that you can forgive me You going away was a punishment But I won't let go I'm holding you with me But I still fight the emotions within me.  I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? And can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face Feel the chill of your warm embrace? And can I say goodbye to you?  I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you...?,sadness
Eminem,UNI,I found your hair band on my bedroom floor The only evidence that you'd been here before And I don't get waves of missing you anymore They're more like tsunami tides In my eyes Never getting dry So I get high Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye And I'm still drunk at the end of the night  I don't drink like everybody else I do it to forget things about myself Stumble and fall With the head spin I got My mind's with you but my heart's just not  So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out  That's why you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  Everybody said we'd be together forever But I know that I never wanna settle down Come around break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another like you Sleep with my thoughts And I dance with my views Everything's great not everything's sure But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now I'm in a position to be another stalker Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward Like our last kiss. It was perfect But we were nervous on the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it Pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant Or we can use a sedative And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out  You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh  Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down And I'm thinking that I'm unaware I keep my feet on the ground And keep looking around To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low  Because if you want I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I know you'll say That I'm the only one But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will  'Cause you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied,fear

Eminem,Happier,Walking down 29th and park I saw you in another's arms Only a month we've been apart You look happier  Saw you walk inside a bar He said something to make you laugh I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours Yeah you look happier you do  Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you But ain't nobody love you like I do Promise that I will not take it personal baby If you're moving on with someone new  Cause baby you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too And until then I'll smile to hide the truth But I know I was happier with you  Sat in the corner of the room Everything's reminding me of you Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier Aren't you?  Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you But ain't nobody need you like I do I know that there's others that deserve you But my darling I am still in love with you  But I guess you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too I could try to smile to hide the truth But I know I was happier with you  Baby you look happier you do I knew one day you'd fall for someone new But if he breaks your heart like lovers do Just know that I'll be waiting here for you,joy
Eminem,Nightmares,They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep But now I'm working to achieve but sleep is the only thing I never see And I vowed that my breathing will never cease To the retrieve then I can't let them be I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 But I wasn't ready then like a lemon's green Now I'm in the magazines almost every week Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife Right now it's better than it's ever been Never fade like a plant that's evergreen It's what I hoped in my heart but my self doubts are getting me Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak Cause I'm new I'm not where the stars be.

Made my bed and that's where I'm heading I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em Married to the game was a quiet wedding then I had to fight to get her Now I'm taking control of my inception Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection See they better marry donna cause when I strike strike Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them. See I'm awake at night with the ammunish The haters know where the family lives. Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger Is gonna lose a lot more than I need it. They say sleep is the cousin of death But I hear shit cousin I am deaf Gang signs I'm a N/A reading. I'm a CEO man you suckers are next.

They watch me sleep!  Let me go! I fell asleep on sofa woke up in reality And daydream about losing my sanity. I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow. So I can see an off note with my eyes closed. But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat. I be shocking in my sheets when I should have been asleep. See all the dreams I'm fond of You placed me in the team insomnia Now I'm Mr hard worker In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up And I missed my chance worst luck Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner Ch'yeah but I walked from that ish Now they gotta put me to rest mattress.

Eminem,Little Lady,[Mikill Pane:] Listen Little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday It's 30 degrees Thursday You work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes Lady the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try And you remember that your punter went crazy last night You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door But young woman The pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker Medical attention could be fatal 'Cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 'Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  [Ed Sheeran:] She's just under the upper hand And goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside for angels to fly. For angels to fly.  [Mikill Pane:] Little lady your mind you've made up Your injuries you can't hide with make-up You need some medical advice you make up A little lie to say just In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip Last year when your pimp just lost it He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 'Cause all the heroin is making you age But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag The funds you have left go where you're from using Moneygram Mother had to get you out the motherland to study That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand Little does she know you're never coming back She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan He's the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer Fancy that you came to London to get pimped by your Uncle damn.  [Ed Sheeran:] She's just under the upper hand Goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside for angels to fly Now an angel will die covered in white With closed eyes and hoping for a better life This time we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line.  [Mikill Pane:] Little lady you're trembling with fear Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer You're sitting facing the detective oh dear The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now The cop is trying to calm you telling you he won't let no one harm you The same question he keeps trying to ask you 'Who you working for?' He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore You're having a conversation you could be murdered for You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before Just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that it's hard He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card Begs you to use it He's useless if you're gonna be stupid 'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips you're on your own You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat And then a voice says 'Where you been bitch? I wanna know.' No prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness You open the front door he boots you in There's something new in him he's silent now that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight you could be killed for an error He towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight At this point your life flashes before your eyes Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye And in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Merc in the street. Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her 13th birthday  [Ed Sheeran:] And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man. It's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly and fly fly For angels to fly to fly to fly angels to die,disgust

Eminem,Eraser,I was born inside a small town I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the lord's house But stopped at the age of nine I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride And when the world's against me is when I really come alive And every day that Satan tempts me I try to take it in my stride  You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I've become Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine to five job or a uni degree To be caught up in the trappings of the industry Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key and you'll see  I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me But with that said give me one more I am another one to take the sting away I am happy on my own so here I'll stay Save your loving arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser  I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs I chased the picture perfect life I think they painted it wrong I think that money is the route of all evil and fame is hell Relationships and hearts you fix they break as well And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps Because you're living your dream and this should be fun Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become  Conversations with my father on the A14 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me With my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans Wembley stadium crowds two hundred and forty thou I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud And to the next generation inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow  I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me But with that said give me one more I am another one to take the sting away Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay Well save your loving arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser  Welcome to the new show I guess you know I've been away Where I'm heading who knows My heart will stay the same  Welcome to the new show I guess you know I've been away Where I'm heading who knows My pain eraser  And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,joy

Eminem,Tenerife Sea,You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that The way it falls on the side of your neck Down your shoulders and back  We are surrounded by all of these lies And people who talk too much You got the kind of look in your eyes As if no one knows anything but us  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love so in love  You look so beautiful in this light Your silhouette over me The way it brings out the blue in your eyes Is the Tenerife Sea  And all of the voices surrounding us here They just fade out when you take a breath Just say the word and I will disappear Into the wilderness  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love so in love  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Lumière darling Lumière over me  Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me 'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need  I'm so in love so in love So in love love love love So in love  You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that And in a moment I knew you Beth,joy

I'll paint the picture let me set the scene I know when I have children they will know what it means And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me Just love and understanding positivity  We could change this whole world with a piano Add a bass some guitar grab a beat and away we go I'm just a boy with a one-man show No university no degree but Lord knows Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth And the stock market crashing and their portfolios While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote Saying love could change the world in a moment But what do I know?

Eminem,Family,Hmm let me go To see my family. Please Father let me go As my mother sleeps.  Life  I don't know about James Bond But 'round here nobody live twice. When you're gone you're gone without no bye 'Cause only a judge can give you life. (Get it?) This is my advice Trust me I nearly lost my life. 3 weeks after I got this ride Pissed like I had way too much wine. I wished that I didn't get one Anyway I was going to the Macbeth booked for a set Even though I didn't have a set one. Scream hit the decks I was like check one. Put on a show but it weren't my best one. Left it dropped off Blacks at his destination Then I was off to the next one 20 minutes later I was on the M1 Tired. But I kept on going Fell asleep without even knowing. No emotion in my face No movement in my legs but the car still kept going. Woke up Lorry Flash Panic Break Skid Crash Skidded More Bang Smash Out Cold Ribs Cracked Ouch. I was in so much pain Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini When I was still on the first lane. Baffled didn't even know my name. Fainted too much shock in my brain. Surrounded by paramedics and feds Trying to get up but fainted again.  See I just want you to take a second hear me out. Don't think I'm happy 'cause I smile when you see me out. I've had serious madness is where I've nearly disappeared Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go To see my family And keep it inside Dry eyes while my brother weeps. Save my soul Please Father let me go. Keep me safe as my mother sleeps.  Eyes closed they just wouldn't open I can hear voices and my phone ringing. Fighting for life can't tell if I'm winning One of the worst situations I've been in. I can hear all of the angels singing.  But when it stopped humming My brain turned on started running. Still in pain but it started numbing The stone cold comeback I made was stunning. I still tried to do a few shows 'cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming. But I was left with a permanent problem Nobody knows about the pain that I'm inside. Ever so cunning 6 weeks later jogging and running. I used the first aid kit like a drum set Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. Trust me when it comes to mistakes You can't afford to let one in. Never done dream for a while The pipeline was blocked So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing. They say tomorrow never dies But he forgot to tell you you can. You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang But when your time's up that's it it's you fam. You can try beg for another Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother' Then do a U-turn I'm gone Runner.  See I just want you to take a second hear me out. Don't think I'm happy 'cause I smile when you see me out. I've had serious madness is where I've nearly disappeared. Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go To see my family. And keep it inside Dry eyes while my brother weeps. Save my soul Please Father let me go. Keep me safe. ⟔As my mother sleeps  And let me go to see my family And keep it inside Dry eyes while my brother weeps Save my soul Please Father let me go And keep me safe⟓,sadness
Eminem,The City,This city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when it's late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I can't close my eyes Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake My hood up and lace untied Sleep fills my mind Don't control what I'm into  London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two  The pavement is my friend Hey and it will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what I'm used to The shop across the road Fulfills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I don't think I'm gonna make it Past tomorrow  London calls me a stranger A traveler This is now my home my home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two  And my lungs hurt And my ears bled With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts But I need to move along  I'm from a city where the rain won't sleep Pollution in the air matches that on the street The black smoke Gets your head into a muddle like Walking into elephants Syringes in a puddle like I was a country boy when I moved out Grew up too fast for my family to find out Now I try to stop my music running into nose dives Can't resort to arrogance With white lies This city wants to raise me But I can't help but see just How this dark city changed me It's all the same see Music is my life but Now I try to fight Whatever I need to hide from North South East West London's my home now Knees weak but we never slow down Now I start to do my music properly I'll stay away from all the negative shit That will follow me  London calls me a stranger This is not my home home I'm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat I'm blazing on the street What I do isn't up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two,fear
Eminem,English Rose,Across the sea By the Tennessee skyline They told me I'd find my Hopes and my dreams  But I long to be In the bed of my true love Back where I came from She's waiting for me  So I'll make my way Through long winding country roads But my heart still beats For my home and my English rose  I told my dad On the phone it's amazing From the straight to the craziest places I've seen But I long to be In the arms of my true love Like he loves my mother He understands me  I'll spend my days Just travelling and playing shows But my heart still beats For my home and my English rose  I met a man In a bar down in Memphis He told me he went there to follow his dreams  He told me Son You know I lost my true love For the same exact reason That you crossed the sea.  And I found truth In people I barely know But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh my heart still beats for my home and my English rose Oh my heart still beats for my home and my English rose,sadness

Eminem,Lately,[Ed:] I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe. Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon 'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables To see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 'Cause real will recognise real is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.  [Devlin:] 5 o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed it's D-E-V to the Z Overtired pale-faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 'Cause I got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take 4 seconds out the game It's time to wage war Scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by  [Chorus:] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be The times I'm living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be... The times I'm living in lately.  [Ed:] I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron But they won't Slytherin too easy believe me I'm Snape minded Be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie Await death take deep breaths try to never die. Never die.  [Devlin:] 2 guys with the same view keep it tight like screws Making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you we'll catch you while you snooze Times elapsing while your catching Z's the masses like to move We scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most Practical to do Driven young gentlemen I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them true! I'm coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got I keep my pupils engaged Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.  [Chorus:] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be The times I'm living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be...

Eminem,Supermarket Flowers,I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill I threw the day-old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that's been loved  Took the Get Well Soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink Dad always told me Don't you cry when you're down But mom there's a tear every time that I blink  Oh I'm in pieces.

Taylor Swift,Cold As You,You have a way of coming easily to me And when you take you take the very best of me So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted  Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Just walk away ain't no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you  You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray And I stood there loving you and wished them all away And you come away with a great little story Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day So just walk away ain't no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you  You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died died for you died for you  Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you,sadness

Taylor Swift,Love Story,We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air  See the lights see the party the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say Hello. Little did I know  That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet. And I was crying on the staircase Begging you Please don't go. And I said  Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while Oh oh  'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet. But you were everything to me I was begging you Please don't go! And I said  Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'  Romeo save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel This love is difficult but it's real Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  Oh oh oh  I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said  Romeo save me. I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  Marry me Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress It's a love story. Baby just say 'Yes'.  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you,sadness
Taylor Swift,Long Live,I said remember this moment In the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild  We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew Our lives would never be the same  You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  I said remember this feeling I pass the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now  We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town  And the cynics were outraged Screaming This is absurd! 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world  Long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered  Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall  Will you take a moment Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if God forbid fate should step in  And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell them my name  Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine  Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you  Long long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid  Singing long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day we will be remembered,fear
Taylor Swift,Mine,You were in college working part-time waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  I say Can you believe it? As we're lying on the couch The moment I could see it Yes yes I can see it now  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes yes this is what I thought about  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine  And I remember that fight Two-thirty AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the Goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said I'll never leave you alone.  You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine.  Hold on make it last Hold on never turn back  (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine  (Hold on) Yeah yeah Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now (Hold on) And I can see it (Yes yes) I can see it now (see it now see it now),fear

Or was it you that broke away? From what we were 'Cause like the seasons love is change And every time I think about it It tears me up inside Like the rivers of emotion But I got no more tears to cry  It feels like you're a million miles away As you're lying here with me tonight And I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right We both know that the story's ending We play the part but we're just pretending And I can hide the tears 'Cause even though you're here It feels like you're a million miles away Away hey hey hey yeah  Hey yeah yeah yeah Hey ooh-yeah We can try to talk it over But we've walked that road before While our song is playing its last note And we both know for sure That it's time to close that door  It feels like you're a million miles away As you're lying here with me tonight And I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right And we both know that the story's ending We play the part but we're just pretending And I can hide the tears 'Cause even though you're here Feels like you're a million miles away Hey yeah A million miles away,sadness
Rihanna,Now I Know,Took a chance Rolled the dice on me and you Opened up let you in my world Like a dance started slow and then love took control Swept away so proud to be your girl When you write a story much too fast Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last  Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing When it's wrong you gotta let it go Now I know Now I know  Remember when we said our love would last forever? But then again how are we to know? There comes a time that love will change like stormy weather A sunny day will suddenly turn cold Time will teach you all you need to learn But there'll always be a first time you get burned Oh whoa  Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing Now I know that when it's right it's so amazing When it's wrong you gotta let it go Now I know Now I know  I don't regret a single day Joy and pain along the way A broken heart's the price we pay As sad as it may seem Baby can't you see?

Maroon 5,The Sun,After school walking home Fresh dirt under my fingernails And I can smell hot asphalt Cars screech to a halt to let me pass  And I cannot remember What life was like through photographs And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.  Moving on down my street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles from the sun.  The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me  Hate to love and love to hate her Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone And on and on and on and on  I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met You and take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain That I have gone through  And mama I've been cryin' 'Cause things ain't how they used to be She said The battle's almost won And we're only several miles—.

Michael Jackson,We've Had Enough,Love was taken from a young life And no one told her why Her direction has a dim light From one more violent crime  She innocently questioned why Why her father had to die She asked the men in blue How is it that you get to choose Who will live and who will die? Did God say that you could decide? You saw he didn't run And that my daddy had no gun  In the middle of a village Way in a distant land Lies a poor boy with his broken toy Too young to understand  He's awaken ground is shaking His father grabs his hand Screaming crying his wife's dying Now he's left to explain  He innocently questioned why Why his mother had to die What did these soldiers come here for? If they're for peace why is there war?  Did God say that they could decide Who will live and who will die? All my mama ever did Was try to take care of her kids  We're innocently standing by Watching people lose their lives It seems as if we have no voice It's time for us to make a choice  Only God could decide Who will live and who will die There's nothing that can't be done If we raise our voice as one  They've gotta hear it from me They've gotta hear it from you They've gotta hear it from us We can't take it We've already had enough  They've gotta hear it from me They've gotta hear it from you They've gotta hear it from us  We can't take it We've already had enough  They've gotta hear it from me They've gotta hear it from you They've gotta hear it from you baby  We can't take it We've already had enough  Deep in my soul baby Deep in your soul and let God decide Deep in my soul It's up to me and I'm still alive They've gotta hear it from us  We can't take it We've already had enough  It's going down baby Just let God decide It's going on baby Just let God decide  Deep in my soul baby We've already had enough  They've gotta hear it from me They've gotta hear it from you They've gotta hear it from us We can't we can't We've already had enough  You're my lover We've already had enough  They've gotta hear it from me in the dark from me As my brother it's too much from me As my brother baby As my lover We've already had enough (Aaow!)

Michael Jackson,Scared Of The Moon,Alone she lays waiting Surrounded by gloom Invaded by shadows Painting the room The light from the window Cuts through the air And pins the child lying there Scared of the moon  She pulls up the covers And shivers in fright She hides from the color That rides on the night The light through the window That lights up the sky And causes her mournful cry Scared of the moon  There's nothing wrong Don't be bothered they said It's just childish fantasies turning your head No need to worry It's really too soon But there she lies shivering Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon  The years go by swiftly And soon childhood ends But life is still fearful When evening descends The fear of a child Still intrudes the night Returning on beams of light Scared of the moon  The feeling of terror She felt as a youth Has turned from a fantasy Into the truth The moon is the enemy Twisting her soul And taking its fearful toll Scared of the moon  But now there are others who sit in a room And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom Together they gather Their lunacy shade But knowing just why they're scared Scared of the moon  Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon,fear

Michael Jackson,Little Susie,Somebody killed little Susie The girl with the tune Who sings in the daytime at noon She was there screaming Beating her voice in her doom But nobody came to her soon...  A fall down the stairs Her dress torn Oh the blood in her hair... A mystery so sullen in air She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  Everyone came to see The girl that now is dead So blind stare the eyes in her head... And suddenly a voice from the crowd said This girl lived in vain Her face bear such agony such strain...  But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried As he reached down To close Susie's eyes... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair...  It was all for God's sake For her singing the tune For someone to feel her despair To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed Then to scream out And nobody's there...  She knew no one cared...  Father left home poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather's soul too had flown... No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear Rejecting the needs in her prayers...  Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live...

Michael Jackson,To Make My Father Proud,To make my father proud To make my mother smile I need not conquer worlds or fame Nor set the pace for style If I can follow through On what they gave me as my tools I'll find a way to sail my course Avoiding ships of fools  If I don't come up number one I'll stand not well apart As one for numbered numbers When knowing in my heart I've done all to be done To always do my best By listening to me myself So he can do the rest  War without compromise Shall follow the feel of constant care  In my eleventh hour I'll be a man aware To face whatever falls my way Prepared and unashamed To just be called a part of God For which I have been named A man and woman's youngest son While growing still a child And that will make my father proud And make my mother smile,fear

One Direction,Don't Forget Where You Belong,Been a lot of places I've been all around the world Seen a lot of faces Never knowing where I was  On the horizon Mmm well I know I know I know I know the sun will be rising Back home  Living out of cases Packing up and taking off Made a lot of changes But not forgetting who I was  On the horizon Ooh well I know I know I know I know the moon will be rising Back home  Don't forget where you belong. Home Don't forget where you belong. Home If you ever feel alone don't You are never on your own And the proof is in this song  I've been away for ages But I've got everything I need I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory  I feel like I'm dreaming Oh so I know I know I know I know that I'm never leaving No I won't go  Don't forget where you belong. Home Don't forget where you belong. Home If you ever feel alone don't You are never on your own And the proof is in this song  Lights off when they should be on Even stars in the sky look wrong Short days but the nights are long When I think of the things I've done Don't matter how far I've gone— I'm always free to run home Oh  Don't forget where you belong.
